I have been hunting and fishing since I was very young. On June 28th my wife and I decieded to take a walk in the woods. We were heading to a secluded resivior located aprox. 2 miles in the woods. We came upon a spot in the woods that seemed liked someone was watching us. We heard a noise come from some bushes. I thought it was a grunt from a buck. We both expected to a deer come outof the brush. I said, maybe it was a Bigfoot. She told me to shut up and keep walking. We walked for another 15 minutes and realized we were on the wrong path to the lake. We stopped, ate lunch and headed back into the woods. We had stopped at some power lines and sat in some shade. It was over 94 gegrees that day, and this was about noon time. As we walked back, we both noticed some very DEEP foot prints that did not look right. They were clearly 5 toed \"Human\" prints. In between the prints, was some deer tracks. The tracks clearly looked like the Human prints were chasing the deer prints. We both looked at each other and said, why would someone be running Barefoot, in 100 degree weather in the middle of the woods on a Tuesady afternoon? There were no other people in the woods at that time. The tracks were not there the first time we passed this spot, the noise was, the tracks were not. At this point I became very concerned that what ever made the prints was still in the area. I grabbed a big rock and told my wife to take some pictures with her cell phone. The tracks were about 6 to 7 feet apart. I could tell the first print was a right foot, that jumped out of the woods. The sixth and final step was a left foot that looked like it pushed off into the woods. No other tracks were before or after these six prints. We both became very nervous and started talking loudly and whistling. I did not want to run into this \"person\". We became a little confused and ended up on the worng path home.

As an avid 'birder' (loves bird watching), I was taking an early morning walk (6:45 a.m.) around Oxbow Lake to see what birds were 'out & about'. Almost as soon as I started the short trail around the lake, I noticed that there was no activity.....none, no birds, no deer, no squirrels, nothing. This seemed VERY odd to me, because it was a beautiful spring morning, the sun was shining and there wasn't even the smallest breeze in the air. Then I noticed that the birds weren't even singing, I could not hear one bird song or call, which is very unusual because there is ALWAYS a lot of bird activity here, especially in the early morning. Then, I noticed that not even the frogs, or the peepers were making any sound...it was complete silence. When I reached the part of the trail where I usually see deer, there was nothing. It was just about in this area where I started to smell this terrible odor....hard to explain, a strong musky smell, not like a dog or a skunk but a definite heavy odor of musk, one I have never smelled before and I have spent a lot of time in the woods. While I was standing quietly trying to figure out what/where the odor was coming from, a live tree 30-40 ft. high (unknown species) fell about 100-150 ft. from me, it just fell, and there was not even a small breeze that day! I have spent my childhood in the deep woods of Adirondack Mountains. and this just went against every natural law I could think of.....and believe me I tried to rationalize this! I then had this intense feeling that I was being watched...no more like being stared at, and then I got the sense that perhaps the tree had been pushed, like a warning. I decided I should start making my way back towards my car, still not hearing or seeing ANY wildlife. Just before getting back in my car I went to an overlook and all of a sudden I heard from the opposite side of the lake a loud howling, it echoed thru the marsh area.

Making our way up onto a trail, we stumbled upon a picnic table and decided to sit down and rest. We were startled to find the whole ground glowing green around us. Using my headlamp, we attempted to spot whatever was causing these little glowing green dots. At the time we had no clue what was causing this to happen, but we later realized that firefly larvae were lighting up the forest floor. Seeing the glows coming more intensely from a nearby hillside deeper in the woods, we decided to scan the the hillside with our headlamp. As soon as we shined the headlamp, we caught a pair or grapefruit sized bright green (with a slight hint of gold) eye reflections peering over the crest of the hill. We stood in shock, never removing the light from those eyes. \"Maybe its a deer,\" she said. A few moments later the eyes raise up to be about 5 off the ground and rotate slightly more towards us. \"See,\" I say, \"It is just a deer.\" As soon as that last word leaves my mouth the eye reflections stand up another 4 feet to be standing at a towering 9 feet. It slowly occurred to be that I had never seen eye reflections of this color and that the closest thing might be a bear. Suddenly I hear a slight rustling behind me. Swinging the light around we caught the reflections of two more sets of eyes. They too were grapefruit sized and green, but were spookily sneaking up on us from behind. I get caught in a frenzy of shinning the light back and forth between all three sets of eyes until they just quietly disappear. we hurried out of the area, terrified, and made our way south to a different hiking area to take the whole situation in. Again we noticed firefly larvae, but when we began to approach the woods (which in fact are connected to the last area by water system) a bunch of creatures began running around in the woods, breaking branches and shaking bushes and trees. Later, upon watching one of your videos and discussing the experience with some knowledgable peers, I realized that I had experienced a sasquatch encounter.

I walked thru a clearing of trees (east) from the lighthouse towards Lake Huron.  It was a full-moon, clear night with very little waves on the lake.  I had been at this location for around :30 minutes to about :45 minutes and had been wading out in the water to just cool off.  I was in shorts/t-shirt and flip-flops as it was summer.  After I decided that it was time to leave I started to go back towards my car and subsequently dry off.  As I was walking back thru the same clearing that I had come from earlier I could hear some motion in the trees to my left.  I remember also it was very still/quiet that night while on foot.  At different times I heard what sounded like large (or fairly large) twigs snapping on or near the ground and thought maybe it was a deer of some sort, probably not a bear I didn't think. Sometimes it would be one or two twigs/branches snapping, other times it was multiple snaps which would occur quite quickly as if perhaps (at the time) whatever it was had some good size weight to itself. I had the distinct impression (or sense) that I was being watched and it made me feel quite un-easy, I had a more sense of urgency at this point of just wanting to get to my car and leave.  Also at other times I heard what sounded like whole trees being moved or pushed somewhat out of the way, I was puzzled as it implied to me that something was off in the trees that had a fairly good size body mass.  As I continued on towards the end of the clearing, the sound would parallel (or stay) with me--it wasn't getting distant or going away from my vantage point of where I first starting hearing the commotion going on.  After I had gotten into my car I felt hugely relieved but couldn't still necessarily understand why.  I remember too, that I was constantly looking around \"over my shoulder\" very intently but figured it was more than likely a small animal and no big deal.  As I drove off (about maybe--?  50-100 yards) as I had already turned on the radio and was feeling pretty relaxed I noticed from off the left side of my car (from the headlights shining onto some of the trees and roadway) a large black, furry looking figure standing completely in the front of the tree line looking dead, straight at me with some powerful--menacing eyes.  (The eyes followed me as I went past).  It completely shocked me, I slammed on the brakes of my car and just sat in the middle of the road for around half a minute (or less) and was trying to figure out (rationalize/take in) what I had just seen.  It stood around I would say between 7'-8' feet tall and it's arms were unusually long.  More than anything, the face is what spooked me and I remember the most as it closely resembled that of a man--the nose was flat and it stood completely erect, was not slouched or bent over--exactly still.  The head looked like it was just perched onto some huge shoulders, the shoulders were massive going across and the upper torso was quite impressive.  I decided it would be best to just keep going as I had thought about of maybe turning the car around and shine my high beam lights into the tree line (to see if I could spot it again) but decided this probably would not be in my best interest.  I went on and headed back to Alpena where I had come from originally.  I was never so glad to see \"city lights\" again until I reached the north end of town while on U.S.-23.

We were running our hounds on coon that night. There is a lot of country past Green Lake up into the Hickey Marsh and eventually the Seney. I had noticed partridge remains where we parked. I didn't think about. The hounds were gamey right out of the box. I cut a young hound and proven hound in. Both with a lot of grit. When they struck I had the feeling we weren't running coon but rather a bobcat. It took about twenty minutes and they treed. We proceeded into the dogs and right before the tree the critter bailed. Cats bail when they see lights like bear do at night when we run them. The dogs pulled tree and gave chase again. Treeing deeper. Way deeper. My son-in-law went to the truck to holler me out if needed. I kept the the tracker with me. I'm now in marsh with a mixture of spruce, cedar, bog and popple. The dogs treed deep. I went to a high spot to vantage my hearing on them. A thick wooded ridge. My radio tracker could barely read them and barely read the extra collar at the truck. Its range in wooded areas is about 7 miles. I kept swinging it around slowly trying to gain a good reading. I could smell something foul but thought it was myself after falling in swamp muck on more than one occasion. Again while swinging my tracker my coonlight in the direction of the antenna I noticed in the spruce a set of eyes next to the deer run on this ridge. Coon hunting you see a lot of different eye shine. I shrugged and swung the tracker, when I swung back into the trail toward the truck the trail was filled with animal twenty feet in front of me. It was around 8 feet tall long arms with fingers, barrel chested and pot bellied. The eyes were close and deep set but aggressive in its gaze, the mouth was agap. My goodness the ears were small. I froze in my tracks, I lost my training of the hounds call. We just looked at each other frozen. It grabbed a very large spruce, wrapping its hand around it. Its hair was black to brown not long, not short, the nose flat, with a face not covered in hair like its body. I really don't remember how it left. I remember the smell followed me almost all the way to the truck just up a trail where my son-in-law met me. He commented I passed gas jokingly. I was very shaken. I had a hard time reading my tracking system on the way back, I doubted my compass. It wasn't the straightest path back. To this day I haven't ran the hounds up there for or or bear since. As well it was the only time I left my hounds in the woods. In the morning after sleeping a bit I rode up {nervous as hell } to try and find the hounds by myself as my son in law went to work.

I interviewed Bill on December 25, 2010, and for additional details two times again. Bill said that when he was a teenager he went with a group of 11 relatives and neighbors from Detroit camping in the upper Lower Peninsula of Michigan. They camped west of Twin Lakes in northern Kalkaska County. The group was made up of several men, about 7 boys (ages 7 to 12 years), and Bill. They arrived on a Friday morning and set up camp about 50 ft from the road and in a spot where no one else had camped. They cleared away the underbrush and built two rings of rocks for their campfires. The two rock rings were about 30 ft apart. It was early Spring because Bill recalled there were still patches of snow on the ground under the trees during this trip. In the early evening, they roasted marshmallows and hotdogs \u2013the children sitting around one campfire and the adults around the other.  From behind where Bill was sitting, a rock was thrown into the campsite. About 15 to 20 minutes later, two more rocks were thrown into the camp in quick succession.  The rocks were about the size of cantaloupes. Each rock landed and rolled only a few feet, suggesting the rocks had been lobbed upwards rather than thrown directly into the camp. The rocks had been thrown from beyond their camp clearing. The edge of the clearing was at least 30 ft away from where the rocks landed.  With the first rock thrown, everyone thought someone from their group had thrown the rock as a prank (perhaps while taking a leak in the forest). But when they looked around and saw that everyone was at the campfires, they realized someone else was throwing the rocks. I asked Bill what their reactions were to the rocks landing in their campsite. Bill said that they were surprised and thought it was weird that someone would or could throw such large rocks but no one was alarmed. Bill said that one of the adults had a firearm in his tent, but did not get up to get it. Early the following morning, Bill got up and drove west towards State Highway 66 in order to buy some supplies. He recalls that he was driving with a learner\u2019s permit, so one of the adults rode with him. The road they were on was a narrow hard dirt road without a maintained, clear shoulder. It was like a fire road or logging road.  Bill had driven about 10 miles west of the campsite when he saw a large animal come out of the forest on the north side of the road. It emerged from the forest on all four limbs until it reached the road. On the road\u2019s edge, it stood up and walked across the road in two steps, the first step was in the middle of the road, the second on the other side. Because the forest edge along the south side of the road was dense, the animal immediately vanished from sight as it reentered the forest. When Bill saw the animal, the sun was behind him and still very low, the trees cast long shadows, and he was about 50 yards from where it crossed the road. So he recalls only that it was bigger than a bear, its hair was darker red than a deer, and he was impressed by the strength or force of its stride. When Bill got to the spot where he had seen the figure cross, he stopped briefly but didn\u2019t get out of the truck because the adult he was with told him to drive on. (The adult had been sleeping when the figure crossed the road and awoke when he stopped the truck.)  Because he was driving with a learner\u2019s permit, he was 15 years old. As such, the year was 1962. He thought about what he had seen during the rest of his trip to the store. He thought what he had seen matched descriptions he had heard or read about sasquatch, but thought sasquatch was only seen in the Pacific Northwest. He had not heard of sightings in Michigan. So when he got to the store, he asked the store owner whether he had heard of any local sasquatch sightings.", "location_details": "west of Twin Lakes in Kalkaska County, probably on Twin Lakes Road NE (based on the Google Earth May 12, 1994 image), east of State Highway 66", "county": "Kalkaska County", "state": "Michigan", "season": "Spring", "title": "Report 28668: Man recalls encounter he had as a teenager near Kalkaska", "latitude": 44.76665, "longitude": -85.00165, "date": "2011-05-23", "number": 28668.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "dpgw9tx8tu", "temperature_high": 70.87, "temperature_mid": 55.965, "temperature_low": 41.06, "dew_point": 57.54, "humidity": 0.82, "cloud_cover": 0.87, "moon_phase": 0.71, "precip_intensity": 0.0127, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 999.34, "summary": "Mostly cloudy throughout the day.", "uv_index": 6.0, "visibility": 9.95, "wind_bearing": 232.0, "wind_speed": 3.83, "location": "POINT(-85.00165 44.76665)"}, {"observed": "This occurred in western Michigan November of 1978, when I was about 13 years old. I lived in Cedar Springs, Mi on Myers Lake Road near 17 mile rd. The land today is a golf course. At the time, this was all rural farm land and woods. I hunted all around western Michigan when I lived up there. One evening while whitetail deer hunting, I was sitting in a cut corn field with about 5 or 6 inches of snow on the ground. It was just turning dusk. I had been sitting in this field for about an hour and a half. I was sitting on the ground leaning against a fence post looking over the field. There was a low wooded area behind me. All of a sudden, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and I felt very uneasy as if something was watching me. I did not see anything although I was trying to be still while hunting. This feeling was not going away and I moved to look behind me and at the edge of the trees there was a Sasquatch standing there looking at me. It was dark brown, about 7 ft. tall, with hair about 6 or 7 inches long and the face was a little lighter than the rest of the animal. I turned back around quickly and thought to myself that what I saw couldn't be. I had not known anything about big foot at the time. I had a .35 Marlin rifle with a Tasco 3x9 scope on it. I turned back around to get a better look and it was still standing there just staring at me. I looked through the scope (he was standing about 150-200 yards away from where I was) and it definitely was a Sasquatch standing there. We looked at each other for about 2 or 3 minutes and I got increasingly scared of it, although it never made any indication of hostility. I got up and ran out of the field and across the road to my house. I did not tell anyone about the sighting until I was about 23 years old and was hunting with one of my best friends. There were reports of a 'Skunk Ape' on our hunting land in Southern Georgia on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. We often heard it screaming at night and supposedly the DNR cast foot print molds of it in the area. I then told my friend of my sighting as a child because I didn't think I would be ridiculed.I moved to North Florida in 1979 and have resided here since then.

The hair/fur was a rather rusty brown and wavy or matted. It didn\u2019t look like a recently cleaned coat if you were to compare it to cleaning your dogs coat etc. It looked like it was unkept and even sort of dread-locked appearance hair. I do recall that some of the hair on the body was rather long about 10 inches and I could see it move as the creature walked away. It looked a lot like of the reggae/rhasta type hair styles but not completely covering the body but just various strands of it throughout (maybe shedding from winter??).  The creature had a rather glum face or expression, like a lonely old man who didn\u2019t have any friends. I do recall its eyes sort of reminding my like that of an orangutang and sunken in.  It by far didn\u2019t look evil, or mad in any way even though we were terrified. I think we may have woken it up and it was surprised and maybe a little irritated that it had to leave its comfortable seat next to the creek.  The hair around its head sort of drooped down on the sides. There didn\u2019t seem to be much hair on its face but it did have some. The nose may have been flat. I don\u2019t recall any details about the mouth or ears etc. Its possible it had a slight cone shape to its head but not drastic.  I don\u2019t recall any smells or odors associated with it.  There really wasn\u2019t a neck and when it moved its legs just seemed to float forward without any obvious effort. The animal appeared confident, agile and very graceful.  Once it disappeared into where-ever, I don\u2019t have clear details into the rest of the moment.  I know we walked over to the site and I felt the tree where it was sitting and recall it was warm to the touch.  I think we looked around for tracks and there may have been some but it was so mucky and swampy it wasn\u2019t clear, but I\u2019m fairly certain we could at least see that the ground and brush was a little disturbed etc.  There was not a lot of vegetation between me and the creature as far as having part of my vision blocked. I could see the entire creature for the most part except for minor sticks and things in the way as it moved.  We more than likely hung out at the spot for sometime recalling what we saw as young kids do. I think back now though, that I don\u2019t recall each of us sharing exactly what the other one saw because I think we each thought that we saw the same thing.  As far as arm size or length I don\u2019t recall a big size comparison but I think they were a little longer than a humans. It seemed to walk with its arms to its side with maybe the forearms slightly facing out/forward like a jogger but its arms didn\u2019t swing at all to my recall. I was totally aware of such a creature as Bigfoot back then, even through I don\u2019t recall us saying it was \u201cbigfoot\u201d. I think I believed in this creature the moment I had seen the Patterson film in the early 70's maybe a few years before my sighting.  It just seemed real even through what I saw didn\u2019t resemble that one very much. Its possible what I saw was rather old. It just had the sense that it was wise and old.  I don\u2019t feel that my prior belief or viewing of the Patterson film caused in anyway to make up what I saw in any way or influence/convince me in seeing what I saw, since they were slightly different in appearance etc. There were other reports in and around N. Michigan the entire time I grew up there. In fact a year or two after my sighting there had been accounts in the local newspaper (Crawford Co. Avalanche) of strange sighting and incidents by members of the National Guard. I heard that about 40 people watched a creature on the artillery range with binoculars for awhile and that something was jumping on a tank and banging on the outside while there were soldiers inside.  They did not see what it was because it was nighttime but the story\u2019s I remember is that it was being called the \u201ctank-banger\u201d.  There have been many numerous sighting in and around the Grayling area through the 70's. I had briefly mentioned my story to the other friend who was with me about a year ago just to see if he remembered it.  I think he was surprised that I did too and seemed to not have as vivid of a recall as I feel I have.  In fact he was unsure of what he saw and sort of felt it was a human. Anything is possible and I respect what he claims to have seen, but I have no doubt that what I saw was how I described it above.  I never felt at the time it was a human or a bear, it felt like something unknown to my mind and creepy. Since we never talked about details after our sighting, I just assumed they saw exactly what I saw and they felt the same about me, unfortunately we didn\u2019t compare our stories the moment it happened. I don\u2019t recall who my third friend was but I\u2019m certain there was one other with us.

As an avid mountain biker I brought along my bike and had planned several rides. The second day of my stay I set off on a ride about 6pm and entered a thick pine/cedar forest on what appeared to be a game trail. After roughly 1.5 miles of riding (I marked a way point on my GPS before entering the woods so I could easily find my way back) I noticed my front tire was very low on air. Shortly after I came to a very small clearing in the woods, it was clear cut purposefully with exposed stumps and new undergrowth. I set my bike against a pine stump and began to repair my front tire. To my right roughly 50-60 yards was a partially destroyed and burnt old RV. Seconds after glancing at it, a very loud thump came from within the camper. All I can describe it is as a \"head\" appeared in a broken window, which had to be over six feet from the base of the camper. From my distance all I could see was jet black fur and no noticeable ears, the eyes were not noticeable or black as well. It cocked its head to the right slightly as I mounted my mountain bike. I rode off quickly following my GPS map back to my starting point. Whatever it was I saw I believe followed me back to my cabin, as very foul and pungent odor lingered outside the next morning. 2009 For a short time while finishing my bachelors degree my wife and daughter lived with my dad. His house was at the end of a very long drive which backed up to hundreds of acres of woods and a large state recreation area called Waterloo in southern lower Michigan. After my parents divorced my mom who is a nurse moved in with her mother to provide care who lived right next door. December 3 I arrived home from school about 7pm. Shortly thereafter (I lived in an apartment in the basement) I hear a knock on the sliding glass door. It was my mother who looked very disturbed and frightened, and says she has been hearing howls all evening. I assumed coyotes as they were very abundant there. She was unshakeable in her opinion that it was not a coyote. I stepped outside onto the patio and shut off the exterior light. What I did notice immediately was a very strong odor being whirled around in the wind. I waited nearly 5 minutes and then I heard it, it was very near the tree line. Howling like I never have heard from a coyote, deep penetrating bass notes that sounded ragged and throaty. It was very windy and beginning to snow, and the howls seemed to occur in different locations. Due to the snow falling overnight no tracks or signs were observed.

I had a Bigfoot sighting in Michigan. I was fishing one day and I was all alone because I walked up and down the river for almost a mile and a half. I was fishing and all of a sudden a huge rock hit the water like 50 feet down from me and make quite a big splash. This is in the Whittemore Area, and I looked down the river and then this big giant apelike creature looked out over the river at me and literally scared the crap out of me it had really long hairy arms and big broad shoulders and the head on this thing was way bigger than a human. The creature stood at least 11' in the air. Then it turned and started walking into the woods, but it walked toward me. it made like 5 steps and stopped. When it walked you could hear the sticks and leaves cracking under its feet. It got quiet but too quiet. Even the birds stopped chirping. It was getting scary. So I packed up my fishing gear and started walking curiously toward the trail. I was yelling into the woods and asking \"Is there anybody there?\" but nobody answered so I started walking down the trail. on the quarter mile back to the main road. I started walking back and then I kept getting this feeling that someone was watching me or something. I turned around and as I turned around this big giant thing jumped over this barbed wire fence and ran up the hill leaving this big stump swaying aggressively. It was up and over the hill in like 5 seconds. This thing was freaken Fast! I ran up the hill but on the other side was a big field. It was gone by then. I later bumped into my Aunt my brother and my cousin. They said that they heard something walking up by this pond then they heard a low growl and then it walked away.

It scared me so badly in fact that I was too embarrassed to ever mention it to my parents, certain that they would merely ridicule me for lack of any evidence to back up such a wild and unprovable claim. I had sent my brothers all to bed an hour or so before and had been lying on the living room couch watching television around 11pm when I heard a noise outside the window the couch was situated under.  It was quite loud and extremely close, just outside the window against the side of the house... close enough that I could hear an intake of breath from the source of the sound. I was horribly frightened by the sound, because I had never heard anything like it in my entire life.  It was a howling scream that sounded like something dying and it gradually shifted to a gurgling chuckle or laugh-like sound that lasted maybe around 10 seconds. It did not repeat and no other sound were heard. I have heard many screams from human and animal sources including rabbits, deer, dogs, cats, racoons and possums but this sounded nothing like any of them even remotely, and I certainly never heard anything besides another human produce a true laugh. What I heard did not sound human at all, it actually sounded \"evil\" to me, for lack of a better description, and it scared me so badly that I waited around 30 minutes before mustering enough courage to don boots, jacket and grab a flashlight to go outside and investigate. It was mid-winter and had been snowing since early evening so there was several inches of fresh snow on the ground but after searching all around our house and yard I could not find a single track to indicate what had caused the sound. There is a gap between houses where the sound came from that is maybe 12-15 feet wide with a shrub-line roughly 6 feet from the side of our house, and all the snow was totally undisturbed. This really upset me, because I had been hoping that maybe a boy that lived a few doors down at that time had somehow come over and created the noise as a prank to frighten me, even though I found it nearly impossible to convince myself that the sound could be made by a human, nor reproduced so realistically by any portable recording devices available to teens in the early 1970's. Talking myself into thinking it a prank had been how I managed to dredge up enough courage to go outside and investigate in the first place... so now I was truly frightened and immediately went back in the house and stayed there until my parents returned home. I never associated this event with bigfoot until a few days ago as I was reading a few bigfoot sighting reports on the net, merely as a lark, and was amazed at how similar some of the sounds reported fit the description of what I heard that night. In fact, just reading some of the descriptions has caused me to relive a little of the terror I experienced so many years ago... and I'm not a person that has ever had any phobias or natural fears. The scream was frightening, but nearly as terrifying as the inhuman laugh it became before tapering off. I saw the term \"diabolical\" used to describe a sound heard by someone filing a report and I have to totally agree that this is maybe the most apt description I could ever imagine of the sound I heard that night. I do not mind whether what I say here is ever believed or dismissed as false, I merely wanted to get the information across in the hopes that somebody else has reported something similar at that same place and time in history and what I report might possibly add a little more information to clarify other more credible and evidenced events that others might report.", "location_details": "The area where this occured was bordered on the north by I-94/Exit 23, on the south by Lincoln Towship Public Cemetery (right behind our house), on the east by north-south running railroad tracks with a factory and woods beyond... and on the west by St. Joseph Ave. which leads from the highway into downtown Stevensville about a mile south from there.

Those of us involved do not talk about it much, I probably the most.  There was 6 of us and we were camping on the Otter Creek south of the airport in Cloquet, MN, Carlton County.  It had to have been in 1977. I was 16 and the others were 15-16 years old.  This was my fishing and camping site on the pipeline and I had built a lean too and we were all out there that Friday evening drinking some beer and going to fish for trout in the morning.  We had a camp site with a fire pit and we had a good bon fire going.  We were sitting around the campfire it must have been around 9-10 P.M. We were not drunk out of our minds.  In the distance we heard this walking coming from the east in the woods following the creek.  I had been chased by a bear out there on occasion so I felt it was a bear coming down the creek.  Then it sounded like a person walking through the woods so we thought it may be the Game Warden, who knew all of us kids and he may be checking for trout lines.  Then came the odor, Worst case of B.O. I have ever smelled to be honest. I again thought this is a bear because of the smell and I started to get a little nervous because we had food out there but it was hung up in a tree. As it approached us, it came far enough into the light to show a shadow.  It was on 2 legs standing up, very tall, every bit of I would say 8 foot, and walking in very huge strides, swinging it arms, making alot of noise.  It stayed enough away from us and circled to our south and stayed close enough to see the shadow. Once it circled us it was back on it's line heading west as it had been the whole time we had heard it coming, following the creek bed.  We were all so scared as to who or what it was we sat in silence around the fire as it passed, watching, and not sure of what we were watching. Again I can tell you the smell was obnoxious.  To be honest, I have smelled bears before and since, and they really do not have that kind of obnoxious odor. As I said before, I am the only one that really talks about it, seeing your web site I see back in that time period there were several sightings in St. Louis County which is a county bordering Carlton County.  I had no idea there had been sightings in this area before.  I can not say for sure what it was because all I seen was a shadow. But a srange type of shadowed figure to see in the woods. A bear could not walk that long on 2 legs, plus a bear does not take the strides that this creature did.  The only thing I can come up with is that we had an experience with a Big Foot.  We never did go and look for foot prints the next morning.  I think we were all glad it did not come into our camp because we had no clue as to what it was.

I was sitting in the back of an old Chevy Citation at the time it was pretty new, my uncle was driving and my aunt was in the passenger seat and my little cousin who was around 4 or 5 at the time was sitting in the back with me, were coming home and I believe from visiting family or something.  My aunt & uncle lived down this old dirt road around 2 miles and right before their driveway which was on the left was and old dry branch or creek that ran across the road and it did not have a concrete slab to cross over it so you had to slow down a little to cross.  Directly to the right of the creek was an old driveway leading to an old abandoned house which no one had lived in for years.  It was dark so naturally we had the headlights on and as my uncle began slowing to pass over the rough gravel something in the corner of my right eye came into view.  My aunt kind of screamed but not loudly because we were amazed and terrified.  Something that looked to be around 8 foot tall, (I know as a 10-11 year old kid it was huge) came across the branch which led out of the old driveway and not running but walking briskly came directly in front the car.  We all just stared as it was some dream.  It was swinging it's arms a little and acted like we were not even there.  It walked across the creek and crossed the water gate which I don't remeber if it went under or over but what I do remeber is the branch had washed out the bank of my uncle's yard and his perimter fence was quite tall if you were staning in the branch and this bright red haired thing jumped over from the bed of the branch like nothing and into my uncles yard.  Mind you were still watching in the car.  We could see it walk up thru the yard and up the hill until we lost sight of it with the headlights.  My uncle turned into the drive and we had all locked the doors.  My aunt and uncle went thru the count of 3 thing and we open the doors and ran inside.  We got inside and my uncle got his hunting rifle out and went outside with his flood lite and looked for it and on his way back which he didn't walk far he tripped on the chord and it came unplugged then he yelled and got up and ran into the house and locked the door.

It was around 7-8 foot tall, completly covered in red hair and 1 feature I remember is it looked like it's arms were almost as long as it's legs and that it was not afraid of us.

The old resort was a abandoned piece of land that had a strectch of driveway from a road that went over a hill down a low part and up again. And on top of that second hill was a old empty in-ground swimming pool and a couple of small collapsed buildings. I havenever been there before but heard of others talking about having a \"kegger\" there a time or two. So we all loaded up in Dave's van and off we went, there were 6 or 7 of us. When we arrived there we went over a gate down the hill and up the 2nd hill to the old resort. No one was there but I wanted to see this place for myself, the moon was real bright and your eyes adjusted real well to the lighting conditions and after about 20 min. of \"exploring \" we decided to head back to the van. Now there was 2 guys ahead of us, myself Mike and Gene, and 3 guys in back of us, at about a distance of 25 feet between each of the groups.

As we were walking west towards the van in between the two hills with woods on both sides of the path back to the road. I started to smell the worse odor that wasn't chemically produced. Something like real bad B.O., musky like and fecal. At that point I said \"Gene, what is that smell ? \" and Gene said \"It ain't a skunk but it's just as bad.\" Thats when Mike stopped in his tracks and began looking at our right .We stopped as well and Gene looked where Mike was and said \"Oh my god, look!\"   I looked and saw a figure about 20' from our location staring right back at us. Couldn't make out facial features because the moon was behind it but it stayed behind some brush just checking us out. I looked ahead of us and the guys in front were there and looked behind me and those guys was acounted for also. I said \"What is that?\" and Gene said \"I don't know but I can't handle this!\"  Off he went with me and Mike.  After him passing by the guys in front and when Gene got to the gate he climbed it with 2 steps and didn't stop until he got to the van. I know this because I was right behind him. We waited for the rest and told them what happened. Then I began to rationalize that maybe we just smelled a dead animal and maybe it was just a cedar tree swaying in the breeze.

I am not saying for sure it was a bigfoot, but after reading the article you posted about   the young bigfoot caught on a game cam that some people say was \"just a bear\" made me realize that what I saw may have been a young bigfoot. My sighting was actually \"the near miss with a car\" experience. I am honestly not positive of the year, but it was near 1991 or 92. I was driving home from work, alone, about 1am. I had just turned onto the road I lived off of and was going down the first hill. Half way down, something ran across the road in front of me. I hit my brakes, natural instinct, barely missing it I was sure, and then I kept going.  It was merely seconds, but I knew what I saw was not something normal. It was on all fours, but the body and head seemed parallel to the ground, unlike the bears I have seen in zoos. (They seem to have a downward slope from their hip to their head.) The body was not large at the back half but evenly proportioned. The legs seemed to be easily defined. Not real thick at the top tapering down. The only way I can describe it would be that the legs came from the hip, no flap of skin coming from the belly region to the leg to make them look bigger at the body and it seemed the bending when it ran came from the hip and knee area. The thing that has bothered me all these years, the one thing I knew that separates this from your typical animal was the head. It was the way it looked in my direction as it ran. 1) In my experience, most animals running across the road like that don't even look at you.  2) What has bothered me the most, and I couldn't put my finger on til recently, was when it looked in my direction, it didn't turn it's head \"normally\". It brought it's head up a little, but it turned it sideways to see! (picture yourself on all fours, looking at the floor. Without lifting your head, look to the left. That is how it looked my way.) I did see two eyes and a mouth, it happened too quick to get a detailed look , but I saw a face, a face that did NOT have an extended snout. Lighter colored than the rest of the brown colored body. It seemed hairless, but again, I can't be positive how hairless it was. I had a radio on, so if there was anything to hear, I didn't hear it. The next day I drove past where I saw it and saw no signs of anything. Not then , or since then. I am from Muscatine, Iowa originally. We lived not too far from the river, right beside the levee actually, and back in the seventies there seemed to be a migratory path going thru the area. I recall hearing about an encounter with a neighbors dog, and going fishing at night only to be loaded very quickly back up into the truck by dad to leave the area because of large branches breaking in the woods. But in all the stories I have heard, I never realized that a young bigfoot is known to run on all fours so I never made the connection until I read your website.

Before it ran---it was definitely looking right at me. It had very dark brown, and/or black hair. I could see the reflection of the light from the kitchen in its eyes. I do not remember seeing any white in the eyes. The face had some areas that showed dark skin, with tufts of hair sticking out or surrounding the face and head. I never saw any teeth. Its arms were much longer in proportion to humans. They seemed to hang to the knees. There was long hair at the wrists that seemed to hang down over the hands.

I see a humanoid creature on it's hands and knees in front of a big round hay bale. left arm straight down, right arm extended picking up something off the ground. Right knee straight down, left leg extended as if to counterbalance itself. I saw it so clearly that I seen the expression on its face(soft looking, lighter brown hair on the face with a black nose)from a profile angle. It was totally engrossed in what it was picking up off the ground. From the extended arm I saw long darker brown hair maybe 12 inches long blowing in the wind. The hair was not matted and seemed to be clean and shiny. I quickly surveyed the surroundings to get a idea of the size of this thing. it's extended arm stretched maybe 2 feet in front of the hay bale, the extended leg probably 3 and a half feet the other way.

My father was living in Ocean Springs and working for Littons Ship Systems in Pascagoula. I had joined him there from Arizona when I decided to try my hand at pipefitting instead of Mining. I had bought an acre of land and put a trailer house on it before I had my wife join me. We were on the south side of town in an area of bayous. One night we were at my Dads place playing dominoes when we ran out of diapers for my baby daughter. It was only about a half mile from Dads to my house, so the wife and I jumped in the pick-up and went to the house for more diapers. I had two Red Bone hounds penned in the back of the house and when we got there they were barking as if they had something treed. I was curious as to what they were barking at, as they seldom barked while penned. When I got out of the truck, I noticed a rancid smell coming from the back of the house. I ask my wife what she had given the hounds and she said nothing that smelled that bad. I left the truck running and we went into the house and gathered the new diapers then back to the truck and left. We didn't give it anymore thought that night. I didn't pay much attention when we got back home later, but didn't remember smelling anything then. The next night we were back at my Dads playing dominoes again, and listening to the news from the TV. We heard a report from Pas Christian that a woman had called the police and reported a hairy ape looking man outside her backyard, looking in her kitchen window. She said it was looking over her back fence, which was six foot tall, and she could see it's head and shoulders above the fence. Also, the kicker was that it was accompanied by a rancid smell like rotting meat. The same smell I encountered around my house the night before. Wow, was that weird.

The incident occured during the summer of 1989. I was working in my father's woodshop when my older brother (19 at the time) burst through the door. He was nearly out of breath and very distraught looking. He immediately demanded that I come outside right now. I asked him what was wrong but he just said, \"Come out here right now! Quick!.\" I hurriedly followed him outside. It was late afternoon and the sun was just beginning to wane in the deeper parts of the forest. I asked him what was the matter. He told me to sush, and said \"listen!\" I could here that our grandparent's dog was going berserk. I could also recognize the bark of our dog in the distance as well. I asked my brother what was going on with the dogs and if they were fighting again. He said, \"SHHH! Not the dogs, listen!\" We were both silent, I didn't here anything. I asked him what I was supposed to be listening for. He said he heard something really weird, really freaky. I asked him what it sounded like. He said he could'nt really explain it, just that it sounded really weird. I told him that maybe he heard a mountain lion, as I had heard them on several occasions. They make a really strange sound like an inhuman woman screaming bloody murder. He said it didn't sound like a scream. He took off running down the road towards our grandparent's house calling for me to follow. I ran after him. Halfway to our grandparent's house I heard the sound. We both stopped in out tracks. I yelled to him \"What the hell was that?\" He excitedly replied, \"That's the sound I heard, that's it!\" I had heard a lot of strang sounds growing up in the deep woods over the years (elk mating calls, ruffed grouse beating their wings, coyotes, etc.), but never anything like this. I can't really describe the sound except that it was a high-pitched tone from a living thing that was very resonant, powerful, and well controlled in its execution. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Soon, whatever it was out there in the woods ahead of us made the sound again, this time for a shorter duration and slightly broken. Another period of silence (other than the dogs going nuts). We continued running towards our grandparent's house. We soon arrived where the dogs were. Our dog was standing next to our grandparent's dog which was tied up. They were both looking and barking into the forest in the direction we had heard the sound coming from. I had never seen them bark like this, not even at bears. All of sudden, we heard a similar sound come from a completely different direction of the woods on the opposite side of us. Immediately the call was answered by another loud report where we originally heard the first sound. Whatever was out there, there seemed to be two of them and they seemed to be communicating. We continued to listen. Nothing for a minute or two. Then we heard two more distinct calls, this time from the same general direction in the woods, yet seperated. They were now coming from a farther distance. Again they seemed to be replying or communicating to one another. We continued to listen for several minutes, but the sounds did not occur again. We told our family members about it but no one really paid much attention as they had not heard the sounds and since we lived right in the middle of an area used by bears and other animals to travel through the wilderness regularly (the tribe caught 7 bears in one summer using live bear traps near our house!) they probably assumed it was just some animal out in the woods.

My buddy, sleeping on the floor a few feet away, was not awakened by the sound. I was frightened, so I did not get up to investigate. It took my at least an hour to fall back asleep. I never associated this sound with 'bigfoot', until now. I downloaded the \"Howl.wav\" (http://BFRO.net/AVEVID/MJM/ohsket.htm) file from your web site. It has a eerie howling sound, with dogs obviously reacting to the noise. I had chills when I heard this, because it was very similar, if not identical to the sound I had heard that early morning. I have played it over and over again. I am a hunter and outdoors man, and I had never heard an animal make this sound before. It was definitely 'organic' in origin. I never thought about Bigfoot living in this part of the state, because the surrounding areas are somewhat populated. There are, however, lots of rural swamp lands and forest areas.

I was in my apartment one evening in December, 2000, around 7:30 in the evening.  We were having a snow storm and it was raging outside.  Suddenly my dog, who is normally pretty laid-back unless there is something weird going on, went absolutely NUTS and tried to break through my sliding glass door, barking, clawing and growling.  She is very gentle with people and loves just about everybody, so this clued me into the fact that there was probably an animal outside, which stuck me as unusual since she has never reacted like THAT to any animal; usually she woofs a little or gives curious little whines.  My brother looked at me and said, \"What is THAT all about?\"  I told him that I thought that there was probably an animal outside and not to worry about it. At about 10:00 in the evening I took my dog out to do her business.  As soon as we got to the yard I noticed very unusual tracks in the snow.  Unfortunately, it was pretty late and the snow had been blowing for 2 1/2 hours, so I could not decifer any particular features, toes nor boot sole patterns.  All I could see were footprint indents.  They were unusual because they were so huge, deep and spread apart.  Initially I thought that my neighbor's boyfriend was probably outside earlier in the evening, but then I realized that that would be ridiculous.  For one thing, his feet aren't that large, and the prints could have been from a size 14 or 15 shoe, and why in the world would he be walking around at night in the middle of a snowstorm?  For another thing, he is not THAT tall; I put my heavy hiking boot, woman's size 9, up next to the prints and they could have swallowed my boots 2 1/2 times.  I also mimicked the gait to see if I could guess-timate about how tall the individual was.  My legs had to spread 4-5 feet apart just to keep in step with the prints.  I also noticed that there was only one set of tracks going in one direction---from a deep part of the woods, across the lawn, and over a bank and into the woods again.  I deduced from the drifts that the prints had been made within two to three hours, exactly the same time my dog went nuts earlier in the evening.

As I made the turn onto Hwy. 17 off of Hwy. 172 I noticed what I thought was a bear sitting  down under a huge pecan tree on the right. Since there was about 50 or 60 feet distance between me & \"the bear\" I decided to pull of to the side of the road & watch him for a minute. It was a warm July morning & I had the windows of my truck rolled down as usual and noticed the most ungodly smell I had ever experienced. It was kinda like rotten eggs mixed with sewage & sulfur. As I sat & watched I quickly realized that this was no bear as the creature stood up from the croutched position walked over to the pecan tree & began shaking it. I was floored by what I was watching. Understand that this tree is immense & the creature had no problem shaking the pecans from it. Pecans that are still in the green hulls by the way.

It stared at me for what seemed an eternity & made a loud screaching noise & tore off into the woods. The sprint from the tree to the woods was about 30 yards or so & it took him no time to reach them. I'm talking split seconds!

My family lived in Bellevue, Nebraska (near Offutt Air Force Base) where my father had recently retired from the U.S. Air Force after 24 years of active duty.  I now live in Florida. Actually, this incident was a series of three encounters over a three-day period.  A bit of background seems necessary.  My girlfriend lived on the next block.  Our houses were separated by a field with a stand of trees on the north side of the field; the stand of trees was approximately 20 feet wide at that time and ran East-West.  The stand of trees ran to the East to Bellevue Blvd.  On the East side of Bellevue Blvd. was a heavely forested area that was either a part of, or bordered, Fontenelle Forest.  I would go over to my girlfriend's  house and visit until it was time for me to go back home (my curfew was 10:00 pm during the summer). The first incident occurred as I was crossing the field on my way home around 10:00 p.m.  I was walking in a NW direction with the thick stand of trees to my right.  I heard heavy foot-falls and occasional snapping of branchs within the stand of trees.  Whatever it was within the trees was paralleling me.  When I stopped, it stopped.  When I began walking again, it began walking.  It was very dark in the field and I could not see anything.  After several stops and starts, I became somewhat frightened and ran the rest of the way across the field, climbed over the 4-foot chainlink fence that surrounded our backyard, and ran up our backyard (it was basically a hill) and into the house. The second incident happened the very next night.  This occurrence happened exactly the same way as the first incident. The final incident happened on the third night.  As I crossed the field I again heard the heavy foot-falls and snapping of small branches within the stand of trees.  However, this time I was not being paralled; the thing was heading in a SW direction which placed it on an intercept course to my NW direction of travel.  I could hear it getting closer, but could not see anything because of the extreme darkness.  Near the point of interception, I began to smell a foul odor.  The odor was very stong and almost made me gag.  By now the foot-falls were very near.  I could feel the thing cross in front of me very close, but could not see anything.  The foot-falls were now on my left.  At this point I became extremely scared and began running across the field.  I'm not sure, but I suspect I cleared our 4-foot fence without even touching it. About half-way up the hill (our backyard) I stopped.  I can't explain why I did this, but I simply felt compelled to do so.  I turned around and saw what had crossed my path.  The backyard and a portion of the field was nicely illuminated by a flood-light my father had put on the back of the house. Standing at the edge of the field next to a clothes-line pole, was a creature on two legs.  It was covered in dark brown hair.  I estimate the height at 7 feet.  This is based on the fact that the clothes-line pole was 6 feet in height and the creature's head was a good foot above the top of the pole.  I was approximately 40-50 feet from it, but could not make out any facial features.  I recall that there was eye-shine, but I can't recall the color, possibly reddish.  The thing was extremely thick across the chest.  The arms hung almost to the knees.  This thing was very muscular.  We stood there staring at each other for approximately 20 seconds before I turned and ran into my house (I chickened out before it did).

I am speaking on behalf of my mother. My mother first saw this \"thing \" when she was 10 years old. You have to understand the way the neighborhood we live in is set up. The house my mother lived in when she was 10 is less than a quarter mile away from the house that she lives in today. All of the yards in that neighborhood sort of connect with somewhat of a gully in the middle. The first time my mother had any knowledge of the thing, her sister and her were swinging on a double tire swing in her backyard. The next thing my mother knew, her sister had jumped off the swing and was running and screaming. My mom didn't know what to do, so she ran after her sister into the house. Her sister was hysterical saying she saw something in the back wooded area of their yard. I guess my grandpa did find some sort of large footprints. This was the first incident. The next incident was when my mom was outside her house when she was young. She saw a large thing covered in hair walking across her driveway. My mom told me that the \"thing\" walked almost as if it was bo-legged. She also said it's shoulders moved from side to side as it walked. Now my mother lives in the house I grew up in. As recently as two weeks ago, something has been seen in my mother's back yard. It hasn't only been seen by my mother, but also by my sister who frequently stays at my mom's house. About three years ago (April of 2002) is when my mom had her most vivid and frightening encounter with the \"thing\". She was letting our dogs out in the backyard and they both went barreling towards the fence surrounding our yard barking. My mom walked out in the yard, thinking nothing other than the dogs were just being dogs, and was standing waiting for them to use the bathroom. It was then when she noticed something moving in the next yard. She said it was about seven feet tall and standing behind a tree. She said as fast as the dogs had ran up to the fence to bark, they were running back to the house yelping. My mom said she froze. She always tells me the fear that she feels when she sees this \"thing\" is overwhelming. She said it then \"leaped\" from behind one tree to another. That's when she started running. She said she looked behind her and it was now coming forward towards her. She ran in the house and locked the doors. My mom lives in a brick house and she has also told me that on occasion she will hear something that sounds like something beating or throwing itself up against the side of her house.

While watching, Dan F. noticed a human-like creature walking in the street in front of my house.  From the living room window, we all observed a creature which appeared to be just under six feet tall walking away from my house.  The creature was about 150 feet away and passed under a street light, which gave us the ability to get a decent look at it.  It was long limbed, but clearly not human.  Because of the lighting it was in silhouette, but we could see that it was covered with hair.  It was walking with its shoulders hunched forward, and did not appear to be in any distress.  We watched it pass from view as it went behind trees and into the woods on the far side of the street. I live in a quiet neighborhood that is located in a wooded area.  My house is on a street that is a cul-de-sac, and there is very little traffic.  There is a quarry less than a quarter mile away through the woods.  In the 14 years that I have owned this house, I have routinely heard animal calls that can't be identified as dog barks, etc., and have seen droppings and footprints in the woods that have not been from any animal such as a deer, etc., that would be seen in this area.

Because we were all shocked by what we saw, we did not attempt to pursue this creature, but we were able to observe it for 5-7 seconds before it passed from view. In the minutes that followed, we all discussed what we saw.  While my friends, who do not live in this neighborhood, were initially reluctant to acknowledge that it was a bigfoot, after I explained the things that I have heard and seen around my house over the years, we all agreed that the creature was not human, and clearly fit the description of a bigfoot.

The temperature was approximately 52 degrees and the day was overcast. At around 3 PM the three of us struck out from our campsite directly into the timber. There was no overgrowth and the trees were still bare. This is the reason we didn\u2019t take any of the marked trails in the area. The terrain is very rocky and over the next hour we hiked and climbed. Circling back into the camp area we emerged at the far end and headed toward the road that runs the length of the campsite. From our position on the road, immediately to our right would be the beginning of a two-way trail. The lower trail heads off and skirts the bottom of the mountain while the upper trail heads up it. As we got to the road I looked over my right shoulder (Why I did this I still do not know. In other words, there was no noise that I heard or any other reason I can think of that made me turn around). There, at the beginning of the upper trail was a tall bulky black figure. It moved from right to left. Its arms were long and swung in large motions as it walked. The head was dome shaped and very close to the shoulders. In fact, it seemed that it would have had to turn its entire body to look in any direction other than straight ahead.  It walked out of site rather quickly. I was completely caught off guard when I saw it. My very first thought was why is this guy walking up the trail wearing black from head to toe? That\u2019s when it hit me that no one would. Sure there are hikers and mountain bikers on the trails but not at this time of year during a work day. In fact, we had spent the previous night here and were the only campers on the grounds. There had been no visitors to the grounds the entire day save one woman who came to walk her small dog. The next thought that ran through my mind was how big it was. It did not appear to be exceptionally tall (not eight feet tall anyway) but the sheer girth of the thing was impressive. It seemed to me that it could have wrestled a bear and easily won. I have to admit that it took me a few seconds to gather my wits once it had moved out of sight. Once I did I told the boys to stay behind me and we moved up to where I had seen it. Once we reached the area I looked to the right where I had first seen it come into view and got another small surprise. I had thought it was walking along the upper trail when I first spotted it. However, that trail began where I had first seen it. The direction it came from was an off trail wooded area. We did follow the trail for about ten minutes but I decided to abandon it and head back to camp when the kids got spooked. On the way back I had my 12 year old, 155lbs, 5\u20196\u201d son stand at the top of the trail where I had first seen the thing while I went back to my original spot where I first saw it. Whatever I saw that day was an easy 12\u201d taller and three times bigger around than my son. Those are the facts. Now, I have to add that my impression of this thing was one of curiosity. I had been having a feeling, not an overwhelming feeling but a feeling none the less, that as we hiked off trail that day we were being watched.

Driving around the park, the camping sites were labeled with numbers. We wanted to set up in a place as far away as we could from the other people. I myself, have known the existence of Sasquatch to be real for quite some time. Not from a personal experience which was yet to come, but because of watching so many people tell their stories of encounters, and just seeing the genuine fright and truthfulness in their eyes when they tell their stories. My brother however, always laughed at the subject of Bigfoot, and was a complete skeptic. So, my brother and I has set up camp on the edge of what I'm assuming was the only lake in the park. We walked through the forest in the daytime, and indeed found many peculiar structures and tree breaks I had seen before on Bigfoot TV shows. As night fell, we made a fire, and watched the numerous stars reveal themselves as the night got darker. Around 12 o'clock at night I went over to a rock right by the edge of the lake and looked up at the stars, while my brother tended the fire. I'm an astronomy fan, so before I knew it I had been sitting there for two hours when I checked my phone and it said it was nearing 2 in the morning. Just then my phone ran out of battery. While sitting on the rock, I began to feel a weird sensation that someone or something was watching me, I checked to see if it was my brother but he was staring into the fire. I dismissed this feeling and told myself I had just brought it on myself. I looked back up at the stars and got lost in some train of thought when all of the sudden, something made a very loud noise that could only be described as a very large man exhaling aggressively towards me. I jumped up and ran to my brother, and we heard the thing walk towards the forest, all the while breaking branches and continuing to make the same aggressive noise I heard so close to me. It got quiet, and my brother and I were standing looking in the direction where all the noise had came from when it made the noise again. Now, I don't speak Sasquatch but that thing was telling us to get the heck out of there. I don't get scared easily at all, and I was shaking like I never had before. I felt so much negative energy and decided I was too scared to stay outside, so we went to the car and sat inside, praying whatever made that noise didn't come back. My brother described the sound as sounding like someone ripping a tent. Whatever the noise was, absolutely no common animal could have made it. After a sleepless night, when it got light out again around 5:30, we built up the courage to go back where we heard the noise to see if there were any indications of what made it. And when we got there, I was shocked. There was a makeshift bed made from giant leaves that was fit for a very large creature. I could see the exact spot where the thing that had made the noise was watching me, and where it walked away, as there was a clear path of flattened grass and plants leading up the forest. The area was wet and muddy, and indeed there were footprints. But, as I was taking pictures the path leading from the bed to the upper forest, it happened again. The thing made the same exact noise, this time it was so close, I nearly fell. We ran back to our campsite and listened. But nothing made a sound. We stayed there for about 30 minutes until I decided to go back and see if there were fresh prints or anything I could take back as proof. I took more pictures, and i was standing on the trail leading back to our campsite looking at the pictures I had taken when again, the thing made the same noise! This time it was on the side of me that I would have to run past it to get back to the campsite. As soon as I heard it, it felt like my heart literally dropped and my legs became wobbly, but I summed up my courage and once again ran back to the campsite in fear. It was only about 10 seconds away, and when I got there my brother was standing there wide eyed asking if I had heard the noise. Whatever it was, it was not happy and we heard it walk up into the forest breaking branches and exhaling aggressively as it headed deeper into the forest. At this point my brother wanted to get the heck out of there, but I needed to see it. I went up to the road right before the forest where we had heard it go in, and looked around, but saw nothing. I was so confused on how the heck it ever got so close to me without me seeing or hearing it walk at all. While I was walking on the road, I saw my brother walk up from the campsite looking around. When he spotted me, he sighed in relief and told me he though I was getting attacked because he heard a bunch of human like screams coming from the forest. I walked towards where he was and started to hear them too, but by the time I reached him the screams started to sound like some kind of weird chatter. My brother, the skeptic, was so scared he told me were packing up and leaving right away. I have no doubt in my mind that we just happened to pick a campsite right next to where a Sasquatch was sleeping, and he was just not happy about that. I know what we heard was a Sasquatch.

I didn't think much of it, as me and my friend have done it many times before. There were four of us, and we set out at about 11 o'clock at night. It was rather dark, but there was light from the moon. The weather was rather cold, as we did this in the winter. The area we walked on was game trails (trails that moose walk on) as well as trails used for mushers, runners, cross country skiiers, and that sort. We had walked about 2 miles from my house to another entrance where most people enter. On the way we had talked about unexplainable events or things such as bigfoot, and UFOs. When we reached the bridge where most people come in, one friend had smoked a cigarette. We then saw a light and decided to go on. On the way back, we heard wild dogs barking wildly, and decided to pick up the speed. It eventually became a sprint, whereafter we walked. When we walked, we continued talking about it. It was then I had realized, some thing had been following us, as well as testing us, or even harassing us. It was much earlier, I just didnt think about it. I had thought it was my friend Warren, who is sometimes clumsy. I had thought it was him who had made noises such as slipping, but it was really something throwing stuff at us. I had realized this about half way back. I asked if Warren kept slipping, when he told me it wasn't, and he thought I could have been pulling a prank. We stopped for a minute to listen when I told the others something strange was going on. We stopped, and shone a flashlight around, hearing noises such as steps, and branches moving and breaking. The leader had thought I had been playing a joke when I told him seriously, I wasn't. He decided to walk behind with me, when something threw snowballs, and nearly hit us on many occasions. It was then he realized that this was no joke, and we picked up a light jog, for most of the way. When we were almost out of the woods, we had again heard dogs, and maybe 20 ft away, the branches breaking, and again, something throwing stuff at us. By the time we left, it was about 3-3:30 in the morning. I did not go directly to my house because I didn't know if it was still following us.

I was heading south on Auburn Dr toward Farmers Loop which was about 1 mile away.  It is a wooded area frequented by homes and in general would be considered a populated area.  Houses are on an average of about 100 to 200 feet apart with only the general area around and close to the homes cleared out.  Most of the area by far is wooded.  It was the section of the road where it passes by Pearl Creek Elementary school.  The school can be seen through the woods.  Some of the woods in the area are quite thick and in some places can\u2019t be seen into more than about 10 or 15 feet.  But in this area, it had apparently been cleaned out quite a bit and sightlines into the section of the sighting were very open.  The school and vegetable garden could be seen off to the right from the road I was on.  It was about 6pm and I was heading home after a day of working on a deck I was building.  The weather was clear with the sun high in the sky.  As I was driving, I happened to notice a \u201cman\u201d standing by the right side of the road about 100 yards ahead.  It was more of an unconscious recognition.  There\u2019s nothing unusual about a man standing on the side of the road in this area.  As I got to within about 50 yards, I looked closer.  \u201cThat\u2019s no man\u201d I said to myself (I was alone in the car).  Shortly after that, 1 or 2 seconds, he bolted into the woods towards the school.  He did it like a wild animal would do if spooked.  I didn\u2019t slow down until I got to the place where I saw him go into the woods which is where I stopped.  I could see him running away from the road and when he was into the woods about 30 yards or so, he turned left and was now running parallel to the road in the same direction I was heading.  I got a good look at him, but not his face.  I could have probably seen his face had I not been so mesmerized and had the presence of mind to look at it.  I was busy noticing other things.  His fur or hair looked to be about 3 to 4 inches all over the main part of his body.  It was a reddish rusty color.  I was mildly struck by how red it was, but it definitely had some rustyness to it.  He was about 6 feet tall and looked to weigh about 200 lbs.  He ran with a strange \u201cHoppy\u201d kind of run.  It wasn\u2019t a limp.  With one foot he pushed off with was more a normal running move, but the other foot he pushed off with propelled him upward (about a foot or less) and forward.  I watched him until he disappeared into the woods.  There was a road about 100 yards ahead and I took off to get to it so I could turn right and in 20 yards turn right again to the road that lead to the school parking lot.  So the wooded area he was in was sort of a peninsula and he seemingly had to be in there somewhere. The woods I was looking into from that angle were quite thick and I didn\u2019t see him and haven\u2019t seen him since.  A little farther up on the right was the school garden that had people in it (around 7 - 10) which I\u2019m now sorry I didn\u2019t stop to go talk to them about it. The next day as I was driving in to work on the deck, I naturally slowed down in the area I saw him (stopped actually) and was surveying the area when a couple walking their dogs were approaching.  I flagged them down and told the story of what happened the evening before and they told me that about a week before they were with their dogs and were on the way other side of the school property by the soccer field and 3 kids came running over to them saying \u201cDid you see the sasquatch, did you see the sasquatch.\u201d  They also said that what appeared to be a Dad was with them who didn\u2019t seem to excited about it. My conclusion to whether it was real or not is summed up by saying.  \u201cIt was either real or there was a man in a VERY, VERY convincing costume.\u201d I reported it to the fish and game office in Fairbanks a couple days later.  The person who was taking the report was sort of rolling his eyes through the whole thing as he seemed to be writing it down on a piece of scrap paper-.

One evening we went \"Moose Spotting\" on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area, earlier, we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters, \"Did you see that? Tell me what did you see.\" I purposely didn't say what I'd seen since I wanted to know if she'd seen what I'd seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said, \"I don't know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps.\" She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%.

We were living in an old farmhouse on approx. 77 acres of woods & creeks near Lake Ontario. This incident happened sometime between the 18th-20th of September. My sister's birthday is the 20th and I recall a small group of family and friends were visiting the house for that occasion. My future-stepfather took a small group, including his brother, my four sisters, and a few other friends out for a \"tour\" of the property. I was not present, I had stayed behind at the house. As the group returned to the house, my stepfather lingered behind in an area of the property where a strip of woods runs between two fields. My stepfather was in the field closer to the house, we'll refer to it as field #1. He noticed to his left something in the woods and turned to see a tall, white, hair covered creature standing just off the path in the woods. He ran ahead and told his brother, but did not tell the rest of the group. His brother rushed into the house to get me, telling me that something was in the woods and I should come see. I followed him outside where my stepfather relayed the story to me and the three of us walked back to the area of his sighting. As my stepfather showed me the spot where the creature had been standing, we all noticed that the creature was still present, but had moved further back, to field #2. At this point, the three of us were standing in field 1 and looking through a small strip of trees at the creature in field 2, maybe 200 yards away or so. My observations of the creature are as follows: It was approximately 7' tall, covered in hair, white but with a dark area on the face, think and lanky, with a head that came to a slight conic shape. It was too far to distinctly see its face but there was a definite darker colored area where the face would have been. The creature was clearly observing us, as it paced back and forth, looking around trees, standing up taller, ducking down, etc. to get a better look at us. After approximately 45 seconds, the creature retreated to an area where we couldn't see it clearly. I walked through the trees into field 2 to get a better look at it, but it had disappeared.

The only reason why I'm taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about. My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970's. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the \"Indian Cedar Swamp\" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush. We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up. These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening. I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70's commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning). The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well. As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad. My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off. We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it's crystal clear. For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We've never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn't for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing. I'm now in my 30's an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I've never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn't see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I'll never know, Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I'm not a fan of ghosts, UFO's or even big foot. I'm not sure to this day what I saw wasn't a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn' good costume and a damn' good plan.

The second time up the ridge could have been from another creature but sounded like the same one. It would have easily beaten any person up the heavily timbered and steep ridge. It was defenetly NOT any known animal like a Bear bellaring as it ran or a cougar. The noise was so loud it woke up three camps about 1/4 mile apart. The relatives left a gas lantern on until it burned out each night afterwards and they went out with a loaded gun or second person with their loaded gun. None of them will EVER sleep on the ground again! That week of hard hunting, the 14 other hunters in the area didn't see any Elk or Deer. Also did not hear any coyotes! Seemed like everthing was frightened away, very unusual.

Rainier in the Wenatchee National Forest, of Washington State. Out of respect for our WA-BFRO crew's primary Central Washington State research area, I've purposely withheld the exact location and am using \"Chinook Pass,\" which covers a broad general area. The event was both a weekend social gathering as well as a field expedition with one main base camp and several satellite camps over a 10-mile area. The area (which I initially felt was very dry aside from several marshy areas nearby, contained a tremendous amount of elk sign) has been used for a previous BFRO expedition as well as other private outings. It's been a consistent \u201chot zone\u201d for our WA crew, who, lacking sophisticated heat-sensing equipment, have experienced a lot of curious activity over the years including purported vocalizations, wood-knocking, powerful footfalls, branch breaking, persons being paralleled, etc. and several documented sightings nearby within the BFRO database. In attendance were various members of both WABFR (Washington Bigfoot Field Research Group) & a majority of WA-BFRO researchers. A few of us CA-BFRO members were invited and held the furthest base camp from the main camp & shared that particular site with various WA bigfooters. A matter of fact, on any given night our camp held about 14-15 people with many walking back and forth only on the primary dirt road to the closest adjacent camp about one mile away. During the first two nights, there was no activity to report from my perspective other then some of the best barred owl vocalizations I've ever heard in my years in the field. For most of that Saturday, August 18th, I spent the day in Seattle with my friend Jamie J, picking up his son and we returned to the camp location around 5:30 PM. At around 11:00 PM our site held about 13-14 people (most of them researchers) who were consolidated in one small area. Everyone was congregated into this section of the camp that was bordered by vegetation on the backside in which there was a berm and trail running parallel right behind that vegetative border. Being a little antsy and not much in a socializing mood, I took a walk down that back pathway about 100 yds, (which was pitch black on a dark night with plenty of tree cover) to relieve myself. 30-40 yards further down that pathway the trail led to a swampy marsh & was broken up by denser vegetation & ponderosa pine (see map picture for camp layout). In the middle of urinating I was facing towards camp and heard a very close step-branch break at my eight-a-clock, 6-7 yds from me that did not give me the immediate impression a large subject was responsible. Casually walking back to camp and not hearing anything further, I asked one of my best friends & research partner, former BFRO researcher Cliff B., if I could borrow his X200xp handheld thermal imaging unit to scout around camp & see if I could see the subject responsible for the branch break on the pathway I'd just returned from. He immediately obliged and we walked to his truck, which was located about 30 yds behind the current congregated area in the opposite direction of that same pathway. When I received it, I immediately walked to the front of that pathway near where our tent was placed perpendicular to the trail and my companions congregation area was to my left about 20 yds in front of me down a small berm. As I could hear Cliff reshuffling equipment around the back of his truck, I put the imager to my eye to tune it and while doing so caught a glimpse of a small wood rat running 10 yds in front of me to the right. Straight ahead, I caught the heat signature of what I initially thought was a person standing behind a tree, beyond my party where it was pitch black. My initial impression did not change for about 20 seconds with the combination of only seeing about 10-15% of the subject. (partial legs, arms, knee & head were contrasted behind that biggest tree in view: see re-creation pic # 2) The subject then began to move its head right to left behind the tree repeatedly as if to possibly discern me or my presence more clearly. It then stepped out in plain view and dropped to \"all fours\" positioning, (see re-creation pic #3) looking over its left shoulder rotating its head in my direction as if to \"lock-in\" with arms fully extended and knees down. The second when it stepped out before dropping, the realization of what the subject was hit me and my reaction was a \"surreal\" shock considering the unexpected circumstances. When on the ground, the subject transitioned very rapidly to where it appeared it was now full body down favoring its right shoulder, rapidly moving and appeared to actually be inching up away from the tree it was initially behind & into a bit of a clearing from my perspective view. Knowing that the thermal unit I had was not self-recordable like a camcorder (at that time, to record video, our set-up was a back-pack attached to your front side containing a mini-DVR, connecting battery with plug-ins and helmet mount for the imager) I began snapping my fingers whispering loud \"Cliff,\" \"Cliff\" as I could hear Cliff repacking his truck about 30-35 yards behind me at a seven-a-clock position- back left. As I did that, the subject, who was grounded, still leaning off the right shoulder, began an almost unnerved & panicked, full-body convulsive movement obviously reactionary to the sound of my snapping fingers and voice (see re-creation pic #5). Oddly enough, it would pause-freeze in between those intervals and I was blown away that it appeared to react to my minimal sound, while my party (almost halfway between our line of site) was making a considerable amount of noise with conversing & acoustic guitar-playing. Cliff never responded in my cautious 5-6 attempts to get his attention and the subject further transitioned on the ground into what appeared to be a \"breaststroke\" uniformed-like motion (see re-creation pics #6 & #7). \"It\" was on its knees, head straight, facing toward a nine-o-clock position from my point of view, slightly down, back straight with clear space in between front torso and ground and violently swinging back what appeared to be both arms in a stroke-like motion. The hand positioning from my view (looking at the left arm) appeared to be positioned as if having four fingers held tight together and a thumb spaced away or extended, but I'm not absolutely certain. I could clearly see the subject repeat this movement 3-4 times and it appeared as if the large upper-body was being held up by the subject's abdominal muscles by the positioning and vertical space between the upper torso and ground. From this position, the subject got back down completely on the ground on its right shoulder and held an open hand above its face (facing me) as if \"blocking the sun from its eyes.\" (see re-creation pics #8 & #9) I could even make out pretty clearly, five spread digits on the left hand up by its face. From this positioning the very agile subject appeared to \"pop-up\" from the ground clearly using no arms and quickly backed behind the initial tree I first witnessed it from. Again it looked at me right to left with its alternating head on both sides of the tree before dropping right back to the ground behind that same tree. It immediately came back up with what appeared to be the benefit of one arm which I believe was its right (am not certain because of how quickly it got up). Within seconds, it had quickly moved a few feet further back in the clear with its back clearly to me and what looked like the left leg slightly forward (see re-creation pics #10 & #11) and remained completely motionless for the next 40-45 seconds or so. Now I could clearly see the full profile of the subject (estimate about 90%) from about just below the calves up. Remarkably, I do not recall actually seeing its feet from my vantage point during the entire encounter. I can remember just repeating to myself under my breath, over and over, \"Oh my god, oh my god, I can't believe it's really happening, right now.\" Its appearance (even with a white thermal profile) was absolutely remarkable & distinct with uneven weight distribution. The subject appeared to clearly possess about 2/3rds of its body weight in the upper extremities. It was obvious that the subject was predominantly bipedal by its build, though its movements on the ground just prior appeared agile, fluid and effortless. The subject's legs were fairly long but not particularly bulky in relationship to the massive torso above the waist as the bulk appeared from the waist up into just these massive shoulders & traps with no visible neck and what appeared to be from behind-- a smallish-rounder head (no discernable sagittal crest). The arm length was astonishing in that they looked \"exaggerated\" and appeared to hang as low as the subjects knees and possibly even further. A matter of fact, my guess would have its fingertips if completely extended (large hands seemed almost fisted) reach mid-to top calves. That impression was slightly thrown off a bit by the discovery the next day in daylight where it appeared the left foot had stepped over a small foot deep berm (while subject's back to me) just beyond the 10-15 yard window the subject stayed in during the whole encounter. The physical impression beyond that small berm, visually appeared to match the distance the subject was from me the night before and was also in wet thick pine-needle duff after raining all night. After about 40-45 seconds of just staring at this basically, glowing live \"statue,\" I had an extremely difficult decision to make--either continue watching the subject until it departs or attempt to document it by taking the imager from my eye, run back and notify Cliff to set-up for recording capability while praying the subject wouldn't leave in the process. I chose the latter, and it was one of the most difficult but unregrettable things I've done in my life. The last image I have of this subject was seeing it in that \"departing\" position (never saw it leave or even move again, just stood there glowing through the imager). I immediately ran towards Cliff, who was still at the back of his truck and was just screaming at him words I don't recall but must have been obvious as he moved very quickly in what I needed him to do. To my chagrin, looking back from where I came, the guitar playing had stopped and I could here a variety of scattering voices from my party and movement, including two people with headlamps on totally oblivious to what was happening, while walking up the small berm and into the line of sight between where I stood opposed to the subject during the encounter. In a panic, and without much of an explanation other then \"I just saw one, get back,\" I attempted to pull everybody back into the congregation area and continue with what they were doing minutes earlier. I had to physically pull some people back who began curiously looking down that pathway behind the congregation area. I knew Cliff was moving quickly and within minutes, saw him fully geared, running quickly back down the path towards where I last witnessed the subject standing. For the few minutes he was back there, my heart was racing from adrenalin & I was still cautiously optimistic Cliff would maybe catch the subject loitering or even departing. Unfortunately, after about 5 minutes he came back & looked at me shaking his head. About an hour later, close to 1:00 AM, Paul G. (WA-BFRO), walked back to the spot so we could interpret actual distance of the subject from my positioning during the encounter. As I saw him walk back to the initial tree it was behind, I yelled, \"stop,\" and he estimated the distance using his own steps at about 150 ft (50 yds). (After returning to this exact area the weekend of September 17-20th 2009, through exact measurement we determined that I first witnessed the subject at around 50 yds with a slight right to left angle, but worked my way up to only 33 yds from the subject with a line of sight from right to left-opposite ends of pathway). Seeing him stand there made my jaw drop as I know Paul is 6'3 & 170lbs, and it was a shock to see him \"fully clothed\" & realize the size discrepancy between both he and the subject. I'd estimate the subject at 4-7 inches taller, but even conservatively estimating its size in comparison, it was about 3 times the total body mass of Paul G. Even with the depth perception issue of this particular proprietary unit I was experienced with, I knew the subject was big once it was in the clear with its back to me, but was shocked how much thicker and oddly proportioned it was compared to Paul. I've always been great estimating people's height and poor estimating people's weight, but by comparing Paul within one hour after and the encounter so fresh in my mind, I'd estimate the subject I saw as being close to 7 ft (maybe 6'9 or 6'8) and between 475, to as much as 575 lbs. As I said earlier, the next day in daylight, what looked like a foot impression dug into heavy, wet duff was first noticed by Jamie J. and looked to be about where the subject had its back to me and left leg slightly forward. Except for the placement, it was unimpressive. Although there was heavy overnight rain, Jamie also found where the ground had been disturbed in several places where the subject had been transitioning on the ground. All of this surface was non-conducive substrate for any kind of attempted casting however and made up of wet, rain-soaked, pine needles. (to see the type of ground cover & me reenacting the subject's movements see second to last picture) It should also be mentioned that 10-15 minutes after the encounter, a female WA-BFRO member thought she was paralleled while walking away from our camp with her boyfriend on the primary vehicle road. Another CA member later heard heavy footfalls several hours later about 30 yds from where I witnessed the subject, and in the early morning hours of about 3:30-4 AM, in a heavy rain, two of us in separate tents heard large (powerful) bipedal footfalls outside our tents (confirmed next day) followed by what sounded like guttural \"doe-like\" grunts. Outside of my tent was a stationed 250D Raytheon thermal imager facing down the pathway of the encounter, but the subject never came close to breaching that pathway (was well behind opposite side of tent) & would've made little difference if it had as the battery life for that unit does not exceed 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Six of us also stayed in the camp one more night (August 19, 2009) and the night was uneventful around camp. But undetermined vocalizations (possibly barred owl) came from the ridge behind us (several miles away) well into the morning. \"RE-CREATION\" picture links in sequence below: (Note)--All \"Re-Creations\" were done taking a digital color picture of the immediate sighting location & the roughly 15-yard window the subject remained in the whole encounter, making it black & white to give a generic \"thermal effect.\" The subject was colored in using whiteout and should not be gaged by recurring size in each individual re-creation as my artwork has limitations. The idea was to give the reader/viewer a general impressionist view focusing on the various subject positioning I recall & a general idea of how the subject visually appeared to me. All re-creations were completed by me within two to three weeks after the encounter (late August to early September 2007)          Link to Canadian artist Brian Cundle's poster rendition of the sighting event: http://northamericanbigfoot.blogspot.com/2010/09/brian-cundle.html ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More details, potential insight & subjective interpretations from my perspective regarding the subject during the encounter. --At no time did I hear or see the subject vocalizing in any manner ---From the time I first saw the subject behind the tree until I took that imager off my eye while it was in a \"frozen\" but \"departing\" position, the subject remained within about a 10-15-yard window during the whole estimated two-plus minutes of the encounter. --Although it's probable based on time and location, I'm not 100% certain that the \"step, branch break,\" down the trail 5-10 minutes before the encounter can be attributed to the subject I actually witnessed. --I'm certain that without using the thermal imager out of curiosity and boredom, myself nor anyone else in my party would've ever known one of these animals was there. Considering the circumference of the actual camp and where I witnessed the subject, it was strategically positioned far enough back to having no chance of being noticed on a quarter moon night under heavy tree cover. (see camp layout map) --With the unnerved reaction by the subject to my loud whispers and finger-snapping with noisy companions between our line of sight, I believe I saw obvious visual evidence of acute & possibly directional hearing ability of the subject. Furthermore, I believe and it's just my opinion, that the subject never could clearly see me (by never seeming to lock-in visually) but knew my exact presence at all times, maybe either through sound or my likely subconscious, nervous footsteps trying to position myself for better views. -- For as much as I could see, I'm certain I missed a lot when the subject was \"grounded.\" Some of the transitioning was so rapid that it was indiscernible during brief intervals in the encounter & can't properly be described. Much of what couldn't be made out in the rapid transitional movements (like when the subject appeared unnerved) was in-between the subject's distinct positioning I clearly recall. Furthermore, during some other brief intervals, partial ground vegetation blockage was also a factor. --At no time was the encounter a scary experience. If anything, it was very intensely \"surreal\" watching \"one\" through an imager as I have so many other humans & Pacific Northwest animals. Part of the absent fear likely also stemmed from the clear visual distance contrast from the subject and myself and being psychologically comforted that so many of my companions were nearby. --Although you can't interpret actual hair from 30-50 yards with this thermal unit, there did seem to be some hair shade (as have some other large mammals I've seen from a similar distance on certain nights) and the subject was undoubtedly void of any clothing. From 50 yds that night while doing the comparison and measuring the subject's distance from me, Paul G's clothing could be easily discerned through the unit as he wore a winter wardrobe with a checkered flannel, vest and beanie. (Note Paul G was measured and compared from roughly 50 yards when he stood at subject's initial positioning and his clothing was easily discernible, the majority of where I watched the subject was about 33 yards). --I saw nothing indicating the subject witnessed was a female (not extremely wide hips, no discernible breasts etc\u2026) and based on size/behavior, it's my opinion the subject was likely a young adult male. ---Based on the agile, effortless movements of the subject both on the ground and standing up behind the tree in the beginning of the encounter, coupled with its profile appearance, I fully believe I saw a more \"ape-like animal\" being then my preconceived notion of what a sasquatch might appear like or actually be. --One month after the sighting, a local friend informed me that a boy scout master he knew personally & his troop had had a late afternoon sighting around 4:00 PM on August 19th (the day after my encounter) about 3-5 miles as the crow flies up-country from our camp location near a small lake. Coincidentally, our camp experienced nothing unusual our last night (August 19th). Several months later, the same friend also stated that he'd driven by our camp location and saw several hunters butchering and skinning elk right in broad daylight. Not uncommon during hunting season in that location I've been told. --The area continues to be a hot area as one of our WA-BFRO researchers had an almost identical but more brief & distant thermal sighting with the same X200xp unit, 1/4 of a mile from this location about 10 months later. On that expedition, several people reported much of the stealth & dexterous behavior I'd witnessed the previous August and emailed or called to inform me upon returning home.", "location_details": "Withheld", "county": "Yakima County", "state": "Washington", "season": "Summer", "title": "Report 26065: California BFRO researcher has sighting with a thermal imaging unit in Wenatchee National Forest", "latitude": 46.85, "longitude": -121.25, "date": "2007-08-18", "number": 26065.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "c23f8bu3n0", "temperature_high": 52.71, "temperature_mid": 45.46, "temperature_low": 38.21, "dew_point": 40.86, "humidity": 0.87, "cloud_cover": 0.62, "moon_phase": 0.19, "precip_intensity": 0.0015, "precip_probability": 0.77, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1012.78, "summary": "Light rain overnight.", "uv_index": 8.0, "visibility": 5.93, "wind_bearing": 263.0, "wind_speed": 2.19, "location": "POINT(-121.25 46.85)"}, {"observed": "This   is a somehat long story but i will try to shorten it the best i can without leaving out anything. I also reported this to the Western New York bigfoot association and contacted back and forth with thier director Mike George. He was suppose to come down and meet me so that i could take him out to the location this vocalization occurred , unfortunatley he never made it down. This happened to myself and my long time friend and hunting partner back in winter of 2001. We were out grouse hunting one day in an area know as \"Michigan hill\" , a state owned piece of land 13,000 acres big near Richford , NY . We had hiked a mile and a half or so off the road with no luck finding any birds when we came upon a large thickly wooded gorge with a creek running through the bottom. We decided to head down the very steep hill into the gorge hoping that in the thick pine and old apple trees would be a few grouse. Once reaching the bottom and crossing over the creek we were both stopped dead in our tracks by a sound which made both of our hairs stand on end. A series of  screaming growls which i can only describe as i have before as a 700 pound hyena with a serious bad attitude had stopped twop grown men with guns instantly. i will tell you as i told the WNYBIC , I have been hunting for over twenty some years and have never , and I mean never heard anything such as this in my life.Well anyway , after two or three of these vocalizations ,which were coming from only about 30 yards away or so through the very thick trees , we decided to move a little closer. What happened then was what really put the scare into us , As we split about 10 yards apart and started to move towards the sound it seemed to move around my partner almost as if it were flanking him , when it moved you could here it walking through the snow and breaking branches and smaller tree limbs , it definitley weighed alot more than in my opinion him and i put together. We moved a little more before it vocalized a few more times  and moved to our left evn farhter as if it were trying to get behind us. Needless to say with all this happening and the constant barking of the dogs from the farm up by the road we were actually getting scared and nervous, whatever was in those trees didnt want us there . after about three or four minutes i glanced over at my friend whom at that time was down on one knee with his gun shouldered as if whatever was there was heading for him . He looked at me and i motioned to him that i thought it was time to leave that area and whatever was down there and headback to the road and truck as quickly as possible. We did just that moving very quickly but cautiously, the whole time looking back over our shoulders till we made the truck. We never spoke to much about what happened but never went back to that place. A year or so later i told something of the story to another friend and huning partner of mine , he was playing with me and said \"hey maybe it was bigfoot\" , up until then i never thought about that at all, then one day the same friend played me some supposed recording of bigfoot that he found on the internet and my jaw dropped , a sound i hadent heard since that day a little over a year earlier was playing in front of me , belive me when i tell you the chills were enough to kil ya. I had him record the sounds and i called my hunting partner who was with me that day (he had moved to florida ) , i played the sounds over the phone and he had the same chiiling feeling. It was indeed , 100% positive , the exact same vocalizations we experienced that day hunting. A month or so later i contacted the WNYBIC and he i sent them this story along with the tape explaining that the sounds on the tape are exactly what we heard that day , i wanted to know exactly what they were. They responded with two of their own tapes which contained even more supposed bigfoot vocalizations. i could not believe i was hearing the identical sounds we heard that day , then They even top it by telling me that there have been several other sightings and vocalizations from that area and that they would like to come down and check it out for themselves , that was the last contact i had with them , a letter along with the tapes from 2/4/02. I just wanted to share our story as i have never in all my years been a believer in a creature like this but will tell you my mind has remained totally open since then.

As I stated previously stated I was a caddy at the time and the foursome I was with was just walking off the green of hole 13 on the private course Club in Syracuse, New York.  As I was walking across the green to replace the pin I heard something falling through a tree directly across from me. You could hear it pass through the tree as the boulder made its descent to the ground. The large rock almost hitting one of the golfers. There was much consternation over this and it was automatically assumed that it came as a result of blasting at General Crushed Stone located behind the golf course on Rock Cut Road. I never heard a blast but there could be no other explanation as large rocks don't just fall out of the sky. However, the rock being hurled into the air by a dynamite blast at the quarry just doesn't hold up in many ways. First off my friend's father worked at the quarry at the time and he said blasting was not large enough to propel a single rock that far as the charges used to quarry the limestone were not that great. Plus this was a single large boulder if it was a blast there would be a shotgun type of pattern of smaller rocks with it, not just one rock sailing into the air. Secondly, the rock that I saw was not a freshly quarried rock which would be gray in color this rock was a surficial rock that was stained from the soil it did not come from a blast site. The boulder was at least 20 pounds in weight and 4\" by 8\" and 3\" thick. It was flat on the top and bottom and stained a yellow brown color as is common of rocks on the surface in that area. However, this rock came down out of the sky vertically as you could tell by the sound of it falling through the entire tree, cutting branches and leaves as it fell it had to have been lifted quite high into the air to come down vertically like it did. It did not smash into the tree on a horizontal trajectory and bounce off the tree. As I stated previously at the end of the game I met up with my friend  who lived on Rock Cut Road at the time as we were going swimming in the spring fed wash ponds at the quarry. The way to get there was to go back to hole 13 and cross the fence into General Crushed Stone property. We were trespassing which at the time we didn't acknowledge.  We stopped and I showed my friend the rock that came out of the sky and both of us believed that it had to have been a blast at the quarry.  We walked on down a grade on a path and that is when we heard a guttural growl off to our left. It was a fearsome growl and I for one shot off down the hill as fast as I could go. We assumed it was an animal. However, what animal growls at a human when the human is not confronting it or even knows it is there? I don't know of any and I certainly don't know what type of animal living in Central New York would or could make itself know in a threatening manner. Normally animals of all type will shun and form of human contact or confrontation. This occurred no more than 100 feet from where the rock had landed under the tree. Plus if you were to place a clock face over the tree that the rock fell through and draw a line out from where the rock had landed which was between the 3 and the 5 those two lines would encompass the vicinity of where the growl came from. As I have stated I never saw anything out of the ordinary and was certainly not aware of \"Bigfoot\" or anything like it being seen in New York State. I had heard of the \"Abominable Snowman\" but that was worlds away. I can't say this is a \"Bigfoot\" encounter, however, two events occurred that is very similar to what others have experienced in Bigfoot sightings. The large rock being hurled at individuals and done so to scare more than injury plus the deep growl the likes of which I had never heard before or since and couldn't to this day equate it to one particular animal.

Our home was on the shores of Oneida Lake and bordered the southern boundary of Verona Beach State Park. One evening shortly before Halloween I had gone to bed late about 10pm. The window in my bedroom was directly behind the head board of my bed, and one of only three street lamps beamed light through this window. The height of the bottom of the window frame was approximately 6 feet above the ground. My bedroom window was also the only window in the house that faced our neighbor's house. The neighbors house was about 8 to 10 feet away with no french between the properties. On this particular night the light from the street light shown brightly into my bedroom and lit the entire room well enough to almost be able to read by its light. A few minutes after going to bed a \"figure\" moved into the light and cast a huge shadow on the opposing wall of my room. I amassed that this figure had to be standing with in only a few feet of my bedroom window do to the sharpness and size of the shadow. Also, considering the size of the shadow and the height of my window above the ground the figure had to stand at least 7 to 8 feet tall to cast such a shadow. I froze in my bed (and embarrsingly enough, I had wet myself in fright). I could not muster the strength to look out the window, I simply froze. the shadow remained for all of about 20 to 30 seconds, then it was gone. About three to four minutes later heard a very loud crash of wood and metal as someone or something had ripped off the door to our back storage room. I heard someone or something moving items, then I heard the big freezer chest open (and the toys I had left on the freezer fall to the ground). Again, I was still frozen with fear and in my bed, and could not moved. There were some loud bumps and bangs as if something was throwing bricks around the storage room (our storage room was approximately 16 feet by 32 feet and attached to the back side or lake side of the house). After the banging stopped the freezer lid slammed shut and all banging stopped. Later that night my step dad and mom had come home from work around 3am (they owned the restaurant a few blocks away) and started screaming and my mom was very very panicked. My mom called one of her friends that was also a good customer and was a State Trooper. I don't know what was said between them. The next morning my step dad and two of his friends were trying the fix the door to the back room. This is when I first saw the damage done. The room looked as if it were turned upside down, then right side up. My step dads large roll-away tool box was on its side and on the other side of the room, and packages of frozen meet were all over the place. A car transmission had been tossed as if a toy. The freezer had some faint scratches on the side and on the lid, but no tool marks or pry bar marks (my parents normally kept the freezer locked). These same scratches were located on the side of the house and the removed door. Missing were packages of my mom's frozen strawberries, and two frozen turkey's. None of the prepackage streaks or hamburgers, or lobsters were taken (they used this freezer as a back up to the freezer at the restaurant). The State Trooper friend of my Mom's said that it looked like three or four people had to of done this, but could not offer an explanation to the faint scratch marks. When I told my mom of the shadow figure my mom would only start to cry and hug me, saying we were so lucky that God had protected me from this situation. Of note was the conversation between my step dad and our neighbor. Our neighbor told my step dad that he too had seen some kind of shadowy figure moving between the houses. Our neighbor said he had tried to let his dog out to investigate, but the dog would not go outside. But as soon as the figure appeared, it had gone away, and he had gone back to watching tv. Our neighbor did not hear any of the knocking or bangs in our back room. At this age I had not ever heard of Bigfoot. But later, (the next spring) the other boys were talking about a \"monster\" called bigfoot that had been on TV, and for the first time (since that night)I froze again in fear (for a few seconds this time) and somehow knew what they were talking about, and what they were describing.", "location_details": "This occurred along the shore of eastern Lake Oneida area adjacent to the southern boundary of Verona Beach State Park.", "county": "Oneida County", "state": "New York", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 27035: Man recounts childhood incident at his home on Oneida Lake", "latitude": 43.1546, "longitude": -75.73906, "date": "1972-10-28", "number": 27035.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "drdjs803zb", "temperature_high": 58.78, "temperature_mid": 55.065, "temperature_low": 51.35, "dew_point": 46.11, "humidity": 0.82, "cloud_cover": 0.98, "moon_phase": 0.72, "precip_intensity": 0.0103, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1015.71, "summary": "Foggy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.", "uv_index": 2.0, "visibility": 5.18, "wind_bearing": 119.0, "wind_speed": 3.08, "location": "POINT(-75.73906 43.1546)"}, {"observed": "The town of Albion is small, there are woods, fields & streams just on the outskirts of town. With the time being around 2:00am in the morning, there were no sounds of any traffic or industrial sounds. The weather was excellent; no clouds, not the slightest breeze. My girlfriend and I had turned in for bed at around 1:30-1:45 am. We were talking to each other, just little chit chat when we both heard a far off howl/moan! At that time of night and that there was no wind to disturb the trees and hamper what we heard, it sounded like it came from the south maybe a mile or a mile and a half. The sound started low and kept going up in pitch for about 5 seconds. We both looked at each other and said \"What the hell was that?!\" Now what really freaked us out is that it did it again, only at around 6-7 seconds! It was like, \"Ooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh-----\" Now I consider myself an excellent observer with a very keen ear. I can hear things that most people either don't, or just overlook.

I'm unsure of exact year but I had returned to the area in june of 2000 and I think it happened the following fall of 2000 or 2001. Me and a buddy(him driving) were out driving backroads spotting deer as it was near hunting season if I recall correctly. We often drove the backroads out here doing just that......spotting wildlife. It was roughly around 1AM. We were heading south on Foster Valley Road in Tioga county New York and approaching one of the main country roads(Day Hollow Road) and were within 1/2 mile of it......or there abouts, traveling about 30mph. As we were approaching the S's we could see the approaching lights of an oncoming car. Their headlights would have shined away to the uphill side (east side) of the road and they might not have even seen the creature due to location, light direction and visible location in the turns. We passed the car at about the same time we passed the creature and the headlights kind of obsured my vision of the creature but my buddy was focused on it and says he was not so bad and he probably got a more vivid look than I did as i lost good clear vision due to eye adjusting to the oncoming glare. The road is a bit windy and as your approaching Day Hollow there is a couple of slight switch back \" S \" turns. When heading south, right along that section there is a very steap bank at road edge to your right side with no guardrail and bank at it's highest might be 15 feet and drops down to a slightly tree'd slightly open flat so to speak. A person could easily jump from the road and land in the flat it is that steap. The S turns are just about as perfectly inbetween the two closest houses to the area. There are NO street lights in that section and a very dark section it is. Due to the direction we were traveling and location of the headlights. Well we could see \"something/someone\" standing right on the edge of the road but on the bank. This bank is extemely short and steap. I would think it be a challenge for any person to stand or climb that bank but here is what we thought of as a person standing right there. It was DIRECTLY infront of us and we could see that it was looking at the other approaching car even though it's headlights were not even close to being fixed on it. We spotted this \"person\" probably around 50 yards away so we had some time to try and focus. Even though the encounter actually happened within a short time frame I can look back on it as if it was slow motion and is permanently engrained in my mind. As we approached this creature we didn't realize what it was or how big it really was till just after passing it. The comments inside the truck were kinda humorous and no offense is intended towards anyone peron inparticular but kind of go along with the sighting. Now the location of this thing in relation to the road and time of occurance was quite quite a dangerous spot for a \"person\" and most people would have probably stepped back away from the road but keeping in mind one step back is about 6 feet down easy. The comments as we approached were with some explitives and without being offensive here something like..... Holy cow, what kind of idiot would be standing there dressed in all black hooded sweatshirt. I don't know but they better step back. Damn it looks like one BIG woman(torso completely visible and appeared large chested with what I'd figure as breasts) Ya and why she all dressed in dark with a hooded sweatshirt on(looking back on it now I'd give a smoked charcol dark grey) Damn they better step back if they don't wanna get hit(we actually slowed a bit due to oncoming car and passing at location of creature so we needed the full road and edge of shoulder to pass the car) The creature seemed to be looking more at the other vehicle and didn't turn to look at us till we were just about to hit/pass. She wasn't maybe five feet from the side of the truck and I looked her in the face out the side window as passing. At that moment we both got a decent look at her face. When she turned to look at us she kind of turned her torso and body with the head to do so. She was obviously big and even though she was standing on the bank, i'd have to say that we saw about 5 feet of the creature from about waist to high upper upper on up and looking back on it now and knowing the bank that she probably had about 4 feet we couldn't see below the bank edge. Her arms wer almost to the level of the road. As we passed and got a glimps of her face the comments continued and were something like....... OH MY GOD is she butt ugly. Ya she is, she had a pig face, did you see that snout of a nose(there was no snout at all but a large very wide open nostraled slightly upturned nose). Man is she ugly, she looks like she got beat with a couple ugly sticks out here in the woods. Ya she sure as hell has one hell of an ape face. At that moment, with the ape face comment. both of us turned to each other to see the expression on each others faces as the realization of what we may have just passed WAS. We did not turn around. we did not go back to look ...... I honestly didn't want to. The reason I say hooded sweat shirt is..... well we've all seen people with one on and we all know how they kind of have a pointed head where the hood is sown together. well she had the same kind of coned head. We didn't realize we were looking at hair and not a sweat shirt. She had a humanish face but man for a human she was very very hampered in the looks department. She was definitely what I would call breasted and large roundish belly and large torso and had to be all of 8 feet if not bigger.", "location_details": "Go out Day hollow Rd from Endicott NY about 10 to 15 minutes and foster valley is a right hand turn off of day hollow. the sighting occured about 1/4 mile from day hollow.", "county": "Tioga County", "state": "New York", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 10136: Close roadside observation of female upright animal along country road", "latitude": 42.1174, "longitude": -75.64853000000001, "date": "2001-10-22", "number": 10136.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "dr6pwe4rtk", "temperature_high": 54.17, "temperature_mid": 49.21, "temperature_low": 44.25, "dew_point": 44.82, "humidity": 0.77, "cloud_cover": 0.75, "moon_phase": 0.2, "precip_intensity": 0.0038, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1019.12, "summary": "Light rain in the afternoon.", "uv_index": 3.0, "visibility": 9.16, "wind_bearing": 339.0, "wind_speed": 1.84, "location": "POINT(-75.64853000000001 42.1174)"}, {"observed": "Witness received a text message from a friend at 10pm.

They had no clue what was making the screams, but were very impressed by the volume and intensity of the screams. At some point, the screams were almost musical, kinda like whistling.

I was in the Army, home on leave at the time. Three of us(myself, cousin, and a friend) had just left the Independence fireworks and decided to go for a night hike on the railroad tracks which run paralell to Riverview Rd. near Brandywine Ski Resort. This was a hike we have made several times before in varying locations along the same road without incident. On this particular hike, we parked in a public lot on the corner of riverview and vaughn rd. and headed north on the Cuyahoga Valley Line tracks. I would say the time was around 11:30p.m. and the sky was clear with a very bright moon. We hiked approx. 1/4 mile when all of a sudden we heard a distant, high pitched scream from the west... across riverview rd. The scream sounded similar to that of a coyote or peacock...only it was raspier and lasted about 5 sec. in duration and did not waver. We shrugged it off as some sort of animal and continued on. As we hiked the tracks, we got to a clearing that has a marsh/swamp to the west between the tracks and the road and tall weeds/brush/trees to the east. As we passed through this clearing, you could see beavers swimming in the swamp and hear typical summer insects and frogs. We entered a heavilly wooded area where some railroad cars and equipment were parked, nosed around for a few minutes and decided to head back. We were talking amonst ourselves as we entered the clearing again when a second, VERY powerful, angry roar came from the middle of the swamp. Once again, it was higher in pitch than what one would normally associated a \"roar\" to sound like, only this time, it lasted much longer(about 8 to 10 sec.)and was very close(approx. 50 to 75 ft.) The three of us froze dead in our tracks an barely uttered \"what the F*** was that!?!) when a very large creature came charging through the swamp right at us. All we could see was a silhouette, but it was definitly upright on two legs, swinging its arms and a massive torso as it was running through the water. This thing was actually making waves and moving extreamly quick for being chest deep in muck, water and cattails. The three of us sprinted back towards the car, occationally looking back to see if it was following us. We could see the silhoette at the edge of the swamp, but it never left that spot or climbed up onto the tracks. This happened over eleven years ago and I remember it as though it were yesterday. I would also bet that this was no prank...given the shear size and the power at which it muscled through the water. Not to mention the scream it made.

Not long ago, I asked some friends if they've ever seen ghosts, Bigfoot, or anything else unusual. To my surprise, my friend told me that she saw Bigfoot two times in her back woods. Now I didn't see this thing, I'm reporting it for her because she thinks everyone will think she's crazy if they find out she posted her story (I'm 14 years old and she's 17). I believe her because she's trustworthy and the way she described it just made me KNOW it was the truth. I've sort of \"researched\" these things a lot. I look on websites at pictures and stories and try to get a lot of info on these things. Anyway, she explained it to me like this: She has a lot of woods in her backyard that went all the way to the highway. About 20 to 30 yards from the back of her house a little cliff starts and then it goes down into a ravine. The first sighting was when she had to pick up after her three dogs (which weren't outside at this time) and throw the doo-doo away into the ravine. When she started heading down there she saw a very large six to seven foot tall animal on two legs. It had black fur and the hair was a bit longer on its head then the rest of the body. She told me that this thing looked JUST like the Bigfoot from the movie \"Harry and the Henderson's.\" When she saw it, it was walking away at a fast pace. She then obviously panicked and ran to her house and never looked back. The second sighting is a bit scarier. This took place a few months after the first one. After some time she regained the courage to go outside and enjoy her backyard again. But as she walked toward the woods she stopped dead in her tracks and sort of breathed in quickly because she was startled. Sitting/squatting on the edge of the little drop into the ravine was a brown-furred Bigfoot. She said it was holding or examining something in its hands at the time, but right after my friend breathed in, it turned around and saw her over his shoulder. My friend said that the way it looked at her with its big eyes made her almost go crazy in fright. After a few seconds, she said \"OH S**t\" and started slowly backing away. Then she fully turned around and sprinted home. Stopping close to her door, she looked back, but she didn't see it anymore. She knows what she saw and I believe her.

First was a very strange set of 3-hoofed or 3-toed prints that we found and my 10 yr.old daughter followed with her feet down a path and into the woods coming away from a large lake people fish at alot. It is located in a nature reserve area right next to my home here in Huber Heights, Ohio. Friday, Labor Day weekend, I took my children to a secluded place on the Miami River in Tipp City, Ohio. We were just going to play in a very shallow area and mess in the river.I was with my 10 yr. old daughter and my son who is 6, and their friend (male) who is 10 also. I knew something was weird when we first went down the path to the river because it was so dead quiet. You could hear your voice echo and nothing else. No Crikets or birds or bugs. Was very eary! None the less we found a path that led right to the river. We stood there and besides this tree with a bunch a sticks laying under it. The kids picked up large sticks and began hitting the tree with them. We then turned to leave the area and try to get closer to the rocks we wanted to get to. As I left, my 10 yr.old saw across the river a set of bushes and a tree shake like something hit it. It spooked her and she ran up ahead of me. The kids then found a pond further down the path and were throwing rocks in it, when I decided to walk back towards the car. I still was not feeling comfortable at all about the silence.I then heard out of this silence, a very loud chirping-whistle coming from somewhere so I stopped and turned to face the river. I heard the whistle first to my left,then immediatly to my right. Then it seemed to travel away to the right and get fainter.For some reason, Im not sure why, but I whistled at it. It then whistled back and when it did, it changed its tone and went down an octive. ( I have studied music my whole life and I couldn't hit its tone or pitch.)But it answered me back really scaring me. I called for the kids to come over by me and I then told them I thought it was time to go. I stopped and asked if they heard that chirping which seemed to be moving off down stream to my right still. I said to them \"listen I'll whistle and then it will answere me back.\" I whistled again and instead of the sound I thought it would make, It began to chirp on our side of the river it seemed. The sound kept getting louder and louder. Moving closer to us when all of a sudden, we heard this enourmous tree being literally pushed to the ground to our right.Right infront of us! I screamed \" RUN!\" We all turned and ran, but my 6 yr. old didn't run. My oldest daughter said she looked over her shoulder to see where he was when we were running. She noticed he wasn't with us and he was standing frozen with his fists clutched to his sides.His eyes were really big and he looked so scared.She then yelled at him and he turned and ran.I only noticed him not being with us  we all were in the van with the doors shut, car started, and he was then on the outside screaming to get in. In those seconds he didn't run, this is what he said he saw: He told me that when the tree fell, something caught his eye so he turned to look.(to the right)He said it walked out of the woods and turned on the path looking straight at him. It took 3 steps stopped, and tilted its head to the side. It then took 4 more steps, paused and began moving even closer to him. It was then that he heard us yelling. He swears that he NEVER heard me scream run and he never heard us screaming and running to the car.He said that it was about as tall as his sister who is ten. It had a very large head that was round but it was sorta pointed on top. It was completly covered with brown fur or hair even the face had hair on it.Its eyes he couldn't see until it was closer and then he said they were round and black. His nose was black and sqwished to its face. Almost flat like.Its mouth was very wide, big, and looked like it was frowning. ( Or sad as he put it) It had very long arms that hung passed his knees  and swung out very far in front and back as it walked.It was hunched over when it walked too. Big shoulders and  a \"VERY\" big chest. He said when it got really close to him he then smelled it and it smelled like rotted garbage form the garage(haha)He even said he noticed clumps of mud hanging from its arms on the fur or hair. It never growled or made a sound. It just kept walking towards him and looking at him. He has been in serious distress at times since then. Fear, saddness, and anger are the bigger ones. He felt as though it was sad because of the face. Anger, because for a day and half we wouldn't listen to his story. He kept trying to tell us all somehing but we wouldn't listen. Fear, because it was incredibly scary to be standing alone and seeing this walk to you. I have had contacted our pediatrician and he is checking up on him and has been great in believing our story. We contacted someone who had a simular experience with his family in Oregon, and he has talked with my son and has helped us in dealing with all the anxiety in this whole situation and has be-friended him as well. We have made this a positive thing for him saying \"How many people actually see a bigfoot! What a cool kid you are!\" Plus allowing him to express how he has been feeling about this whole thing. He is excited about it, then very reserved about it too.  He also picked up a strange stick which I'm sending off to be evaluated. It looks as though something has used it for something. It was sanded down smooth by something and has tan and black animal hair fibers in certain parts of the wood.

While fishing at night we have heard some very strange sounds. We went out hoping to hear something or find another track. We were sitting by the lake originally with nothing happening. After it being cool and a bit rainy, we decided to leave the area. We were going up the road when XXX made the suggestion to pull over by the archery field to see if we could see any deer on the way out. When we pulled over to the field we caught a glimpse of eyes. We stepped out of our vehicle using a large mag-light and we glassed the area where we saw the eyes and caught the eyes moving over the grass line. The thing that made me think this was strange was the distance between the eyes. They were about a foot apart and shined green when the light hit them. Then, it moved left to right and appeared to be just above the grass line which was roughly about four foot high. When it moved to the right is when it got interesting... It stood up straight and looked toward us. The eyes where clearly another 4 foot above the grass line. It then turned to its left and walked across the field into the wood line. We were all stunned. We decided to leave the area kind of in a state of shock...as we were kind of freaked out. We pulled out and headed out towards the road when XXXXXX said we should go back and get a size comparison. He said we watched it leave so we should go back for a more accurate comparison. It needs to be stated at this time that I am an avid hunter and was a Nuisance animal control specialist with the ODNR for three years. What we had seen at that point was nothing that should have been in this area. Not a deer, not a coyote, not a bear...this was much larger. We turned the truck around and pulled back into the archery area and made a general plan. XXX would keep the truck running as I would walk to the edge of the field with the mag-light. XXXXXX wanted to walk across towards the tree line to where we saw it go into the woods so we would get a height comparison. The truck lights were on....as XXXXXX started across the field, I was trying to glass the edge of the field with the light showing him which way to go. About 30 yards in or so the eyes reappeared in the same location it entered into the woods...low to the ground just above the grass line. I hollered to XXXXXX that it was back and he needed to go to the right. Once he started moving to the right, he looked back at the truck and said he could not see the eyes. He was looking back into the truck lights off and on. This thing stood straight up and looked down at XXXXXX. He was probably just about 30 maybe at most 40 yards from this thing. Jeremy is 6 foot and this thing just dwarfed him in size. I hollered for him to freeze! XXXXXX turned and looked at us, and I told him to move back to us slowly. XXX and I were honestly rattled. XXX was asking me what it is..what is it??\u2026. as I was trying to rationalize what we were seeing. I had to answer him with a, I don't know??? As XXXXXX was walking back towards us slowly....facing away from us...all I could think was if it wanted him, we could never had made it to him in time. It stared at him till he was more than half way back and once again turned left and went into the woods. XXXXXX never saw the eyes. He said he did hear something moving into the woods...but it was faint at that point.

It was about 6:00 P.M. when I got to his house and we decided to build a small camp fire just for the sake of fun. He lives right next to a small wooded cliff that follows a tiny  river. Right behind his house next to the cliff that leads into the small woods is his security light that stays on all night. It was about 9:40 P.M. that night and we had a really good camp fire going when he said \u201cwe are just about out of wood\u2026 do you think you could take the flash light and pick up some small twigs to keep this fire going.\u201d At the time I really didn\u2019t think anything of it and being a hunter and all I\u2019m not scared of going into a woods at night. So, I said \u201csure\u201d and took the flash-light and proceeded down a cut path on the face of the hilly cliff. The first step I took heading down that hill I will never forget for the rest of my life. As I took my first step onto the path I saw a massive black object/thing at the bottom of the cliff in a wall of weeds taller than me. Now, I\u2019m about 6\u2019 1\u201d and this black thing was a good 8 feet in height or taller. The weeds at the bottom were it stood are a good 7\u2019 in height or longer themselves. With said, I just stood there froze in fear asking the same question in my head \u2018what the hell is it?\u2019 As I stood there it just moved side to side like a large animal studying it\u2019s pray for the kill. At that time it looked up at me with its red eyes and that is when my heart dropped to the bottom of my small intestine. The red eyes on this thing glowed off the security-light at the top of the cliff and I was just scared shitless. After about two minutes of just standing their motionless, I finally managed to move my arm in a backwards motion to touch my friend on the shoulder. When I did that Josh said \u201cwhat\u201d and turned towards me where he got a fearful look at this thing as well. He then yield \u201cshit\u201d and took off for the door to his house leaving me just standing their thinking \u2018o-shit he just left me hear by myself with this thing.\u2019 About that time this large bear/human looking thing just took off running in a mad run for the riverside; crossing it towards the field on the other side.

This is an account of events that transpired during mine and my friends 5 day hunting trip on a 40 acre tract in Nashport, Ohio, in Muskingum County. This land adjoins Dillon State Park, which is 2,285 acres of state ground. Both my friend and I are experienced woodsmen and hunters, in having been in nature our whole lives. We are confident in our knowledge of animals, their behavior, and calls. This compiling of events at times left us confused, awestruck and at a loss for words. We both went into the woods with the understanding that there are some things that cannot be explained or fully understood yet. However, we left our trip with a much greater understanding than we thought imaginable when planning this trip. 12/1/15 Tuesday Just after dusk. Light rain and no wind. We heard a large tree knocked over in the woods. There was no wind or outside influence that should have caused the tree to crash down. About 30-45 minutes later, we heard a second tree fall, which sounded larger. Around 8pm we began to hear tree knocks coming from 3 different locations simultaneously. The first 2 sounded like someone hitting 2x4\u2019s together. The 3rd on the other hand was much louder. It sounded like someone hit the tree with a very large Louisville Slugger. Around 10pm, we heard what sounded like someone walking through the woods whistling. It was a human-like whistle, but we were the only people around. At about 3am, my friend stepped out of the camper to use the bathroom. Upon walking outside, he heard another loud tree knock from the 3rd location as before. 12/2/15 Wednesday We hunted all day and returned to camp. After dark, the tree knocks began. This time it was only 2 locations. Around 10 to 10:30pm we began to hear whooping sounds coming off of a ridge about a \u00bc of a mile away. Still inside the camper, the sounds were so loud we could feel them. The whoops lasted 15-20 seconds without pause. Within 5 minutes we heard the call again, but this time the duration of the call was shorter. We stepped outside of the camper to get a better sound quality and then heard a 3rd set of whoops, this time so loud the calls could be felt in your chest. When these calls were finally finished the woods and entire area around us went quiet. Not a sound. Just as the night before we continued to hear wood knocks. Also noted we could hear something banging/ beating on cars in the junkyard below our camp site. At times it was so loud whatever this was seemed to be upset and trying to rip off a car door. The junkyard is inaccessible at night.  Just as the night before my friend awoke around 3am to use the bathroom and upon stepping out of the camper was confronted with a very loud knock from the same area as the night before. 12/3/15 Thursday The evening was quiet until about 9-9:30pm. Out of the blue, we heard a very long, very deep, aggressive almost tarzan like yell coming from the same ridge as the whoops the night before. This brought a chill down our spines it was so loud. It was long and powerful and lasted a solid 20 seconds. Trees knocks continued from the same areas as previous nights almost like we were being observed all evening. They were lesser in frequency on this evening however. About an hour later we began to hear coyotes yipping near the same ridge as all the calls have been coming from. There was an answer to the coyotes, which was similar but definitely not a coyote. The tone and pitch were different and it was much louder. It was very bone chilling to say the least. Shortly after this we could hear growling sounding like it was coming from just outside the camper. We loaded our guns and prepared for an encounter with whatever was out there. We stepped out with a bright flashlight but we could not spot anything. The tree knocks continued until we went to bed. 12/4/15 Friday Sitting around the fire around 9pm, we heard another tarzan yell, this time it was on a further ridge. Guessing around a \u00bd to \u00be of a mile away. It was long and as loud of a call as the evening before, just further off in the distance. It was quiet again until about 9:45. From the lake and waterway about a \u00bc to \u00bd mile away, we heard a blood curdling high pitched scream. Also by the water way is a long set of rail road tracks that I wanted to note of here. From this point on we heard screams every 5 seconds. The screams progressively came closer and closer, moving down the creek bottom between the two large ridges. In no more than 30-60 seconds, the screaming had moved from the waterway again about a \u00bc to \u00bd a mile away to what sounded like 100 to 150 yards away at the tree line. About 10 to 15 seconds later we heard what sounded like someone or something jumping on the hood of a car and over the 8ft tall (give or take) junkyard fence, clipping it as it went over. This was astonishing because in this 10 to 15 seconds of time this thing moved through 400 yards of heavy cover. I do not know of any person or animal that could do this that would also be responsible for these noises. A few minutes after all of this commotion, we heard the same blood curdling screams coming off the ridge behind us as all of the screams as the nights before. 12/5/15 Saturday We set up a two man deer drive for the morning down the same ridges and holler from where the screams the night before were moving through. Moving as quickly as possible, it still took me an hour to cover and navigate the same ground as the high pitched screaming the night before. We decided to check out the area around the waterway for tracks to try and confirm what we thought we had been hearing throughout the week. At one end of the spillway, the water had receded to depths of only about 4 inches. There were nearly 20 tracks coming from the main ravine and rail road tracks and into the shallow end of the spillway. They all enter at the same place but veer off in 3 different directions. The tracks appeared to be 14-16 inches in length, 3-4 inches at the heel and 6 to 8 inches at the toe. This creature appeared to have a stride of nearly or about 5ft toe to toe. My friend documented these as pictures on his cell phone. Upon further investigation we found more tracks 20-30 yards away in the sand on the bank. We took pictures of these as well. One set was slightly smaller but when up next to my 11 \u00bd size hunting boot it dwarfed my feet in comparison. We found another, larger track near these. This footprint was 16-18 inches long at least 4 inches at the heel and 8 inches or more at the toes. It was an older track but still stood out to us. We have a clear picture of this track up against my friends size 13 hunting boot and this track just swallowed it. These impressions sunk deeper than anything my friend or myself could recreate, and we are not small men at 210 and 185 lbs respectively. Investigating the bank line we could see multiple shellfish that had been eaten (potential secondary food source to all of the gut piles and wounded deer from gun season) There were no other animal tracks in the area that would have been known to be feeding on these aka raccoons. Also noted we noticed multiple footprints that looked to be from a child barefoot. These looked fresh. Why someone would let their child run around barefoot in December in cold water and mud is beyond me? Still not sure what to make of this. 12/6/15 Monday Upon returning home I spoke to my girlfriend about what had gone on during our hunting trip and finding the tracks and she was mind blown and interested. Since the tracks were on public land and deer gun season was over I know it would be safe to take her down to the water and show her the tracks and let her see the area. First I took her down to a sand bar to show her an angle I had at a nice deer on Wednesday. When we got down there she said wow bigfoot. When we looked down there was a fresh set of tracks in the 14-16 inch range very similar to the other ones noted already. They were so fresh you could see where the mud had squished up between its toes.  She took pictures on her phone with her feet next to them as reference. I then took her over to the sandy bank and showed her the tracks my friend and I had found to get a second set of pictures. Upon getting over there we found another type of track. It was roughly 14 inches in length but appeared to have severe hammer toe and or arthritis. It was roughly 4 inches at the heel and roughly 8 inches at the toes. We took pictures of this track as well. When exploring near the wood line I noticed how a very large creature had been moving through there. I found a large impression in the leaves. I began to remove them to get a better look at what was below. We found what appears to be very very large footprints. These were between 20 and 24 inches in length, well over 5 inches at the heel, and 10 to 12 inches at the toe. A picture was also taken of this impression. Upon seeing these the feeling of being watched began to overwhelm my girlfriend and we quietly left the area. At the end of this trip we left with some astounding experiences and a sense of shock. However, we both feel this is not a series of coincidences or random actions. Given our encounters and physical evidence which we were able to document, we strongly feel there is one explanation Bigfoot. Being experienced trackers, we feel these creatures are using the railroad tracks as a highway to come and go with minimal trace. Our interactions this week led two outdoorsmen who are very comfortable in uninhabited woods to sleep with loaded guns within arm\u2019s reach. Each of us there will think twice before staying or wondering near or in nearly untouched woods at night alone.

We looked at each other and bolted out of the woods to the parking lot of the Giant Eagle grocery that was there at the time. I was so scared a remembered the incident for years. Although I put it down to some animal, like a wildcat. I discovered the website and read report #4967, but never put two and two together until listening to a vocalization recording that sounded exactly like the scream we heard that night. Then report #7832 showed up and their encounter took place around the same time I lived there.  I just felt I needed to tell someone that I heard something too. I also believe something followed my father and I in the Mohican State Forest as we walked along the river one hot summer day.  The land sloped upward from where we were and I thought something was up there above us because the bushes kept moving as if something was making it's way through the brush parallel to us.  I got scared and wanted if we could go back to our cabin.  I told my Dad I was tired and hot and couldn't walk anymore.

I have lived in this same apartment complex for nearly twenty years and have often heard this incredibly loud howling sound. I agree with A.D. that the sound is difficult to describe. It is a very loud, somewhat high-pitched sound that originally suggested an animal in pain. I have recently taken up an interest in Bigfoot, and after some books on the subject began to wonder whether the sound I heard was perhaps one of the creatures. Then this morning I ran across A.D.'s report and thought, \"Ah-ha! So I am not the only person who has wondered about these cries.\" After giving thought to the possibility that the cry is that of Bigfoot, it crossed my mind that rather than a cry of physical pain it might be instead a cry of emotional pain, the cry of a lonely being hoping to hear an answering cry. I have only heard the cry at night, and not as I recall in winter. For many years the cry was fairly frequent. I have not heard it now for more than a year. The area behind the apartment complex is heavily wooded. There is a dirt roadway that goes back (north) a hundred yards or so to a gas well drilled about four or five years ago and then capped off and left untended. Another fifty yards or so north is a railroad track with frequent trains. Beyond the track is more woods, within which is the remains of a toxic waste dump that was cleaned up by the EPA eight or ten years ago.

We were in the woods south of town in the hopes to find the plant \"gensing\".  The timber in the area is very old with dense undergrouth.  Now before I continue the story I have a few other things to let you know about this area. There are stories of coon hunters hearing this sound and having there dogs come running back to them with their tales tucked.  They say that what ever it is, it is not anything they have ever heard. All of the things I am telling you are very true.  They have all happened within 5-10 miles of each other. back to my Dad and I.  We were walking through the woods when this very loud, sort ofrumbley growling howl.  I dont know but I have spent many many hours in the woods and have never ever heard a sound like this.  When we heard this sound all of my hair stood up on the back of my kneck.  I turned to my father and with fright said,  \"what was that\".  With his eyes enlarged he replyed,  \"i dont know\".  Needless to say that had ended our hunt for genseng.  On our way out of the woods we heard the same sound three times.  It was almost like the sound was that of letting us know we were too close to what ever it was. Now listen to this.  Believe it or not the next summer my dad had returned to the same stretch of woods about 2 miles from the previous year.  Again he was hunting for genseng and goldenseal.  He had come home early from his hunt which is not usual.  When he came home I had asked him if he had found anything and he said, \"no but I saw something that shouldnt have been there\".  He said that he was walking through the hills and had to cross the creek bottom.  There in the creek bottom was a footprint.  He said that he looked at it for a minute and then said to himself, \"there shouldnt be anyone out here in bare feet\".  the closest house is about a half a mile from where he said that he was.  Needless to say that was the last time that we have ever went to those woods.  Ocassionaly we walk the railroad tracks that run adjacent to the milesw of woods that run that creek bottom.  Every time we are in the area we get this fealling that something is watching us.  You know what I am talking about.  All the hair stands up on your kneck and you get the fealing that that you are not welcome there at the time.  Wtihout ignoring this feeling we just turn and walk away. I hope I am interesting you because I really believe \"bigfoot\" to be real. Now here is why I strongly believe on top of all these things I have told you about. My brother was driving down the road at a late hour of the night.  He was driving down the raod with two girls in the car, lucky him.  The same roud that runs north and south of the sight were my father seen the footprint.  As he came to crest of a small hill he said that he ahd seen this set of redish looking eyes.  To the right side of the road is a corn field that boarders the woods.  Mind you the corn is at full growth.  As he got closer to the eyes he said that what ever it was stood up and was at least one foot above the corn.  The two girls turned and emediately started crying in fear of what they had just seen.  He said that she just kept telling Justin, mybrother, to take her home, take me home now is what she told him.  Justin said that as they approached the eyes they stood above the corn.  In aww he stoped the car a faced the headlights at the creature.  He said that the animal turned and looked back at them for about three seconds.  he described the animal as being fury and having a greyish light colored \"V\" shape of hair down its chest.  He said that as it turned he was amazed by the size of the creature.  To this day one of the girls that was with im will NOT talk about what she seen that night.  The other girl will slap you if you even bring it up because it scares her soo bad.  My brother still has not hunted or fished that area scince he has seen that creature. Three years later my mom was on her way to work.  It was early morning, just light enough to see without headlights.  When she crossed the bridge, the same bridge that crosses the tracks that run down these woods, she said that she saw this very large man lookinmg hairy thing walking down the railroad tracks.  She said that what ever it was, it was not human.  She said that it had to be atleast 8 feet tall and very hairy.  She said that she thought about turning around to see just what the heck this thing was but she could not build up the courage. I really do know with out any doubt that bigfoot is real.  The type of cover that i have seen on the internet that people have described as bigfoot teritory is the ide4al cover around these sightings.  I hope you take my stories serious and i would like to know if you fallow up on the study of these in the area.

On Memorial Day weekend in 98 me and a friend went camping in Wayne National Forest.  We arrived friday late night, and set up camp in an overhang. The first night was uneventfull.  The second evening we had a big steak meal on the open fire.  After we ate and cleaned up dishes, just for fun and giggles, I howled like I heard on one of the web sites (the howl that sounds like an air raid warning) while my friend was making sounds like a monkey.  We did this for about fifteen minutes.  The time was now 7:15 pm.  My friend then proceeded to chop up fire wood for the nights fire.  I went and sat down in a chair and turned on the the portable radio about half volume.  At 8:00pm my friend was done choping wood.  He then sat down to relax.  At 9:10pm I heard what sounded like a tree being snapped in half over the radio, so I turned down the radio and said to my friend \"did you hear that?\".  My friend said no.  So I turned off the radio for the night.  At 9:15pm out to the left of the over hang in the woods there was this loud crash that shook the ground beneeth our feet.  We looked at each other and grabbed our guns and loaded them, and got our flashlights and started combing the woods with the light.  After about an hour of looking and listening we went back to relaxing.  During the time we were looking in the woods all we heard was a whipoorwill moving about and an owl hooting.  My friend then proceeded to drink beer, while I sat there gazing at the fire.  I was wondering about the sounds that I heard earlier in the evening.  The sound of the crash was like something picked up a 300 pound rock or a fallen tree trunk and slammed it to the ground, kind of like a warning to get out of the woods. About 12:30 am my friend passed out on a cot.  My friend started snoring heavily.  I went and put more wood on the fire.  After that I went and put my chair in the dark area of the overhang, and blocked the light from the lantern so it would not shine on me or get in my eyes.  I would shine the flash light out in the woods about every fifteen minutes.  At about 1:00 am,out to the right side of the overhang in the woods a tree started shaking violentley back and forth for about 20 minutes.while this is going on , I have the flashlight on pointed in the direction of the tree being shaken.  I could not see anything -  just hear the sounds of the tree.  Then it stopped.  I then ran over and woke my friend up and said there is something out in the woods and I am scared.  Then my friend sat up looked around then passed back out.  At that time my heart started to pound a little heavy.  I grabbed my gun and put it on my lap as I sat back down in the chair.  I then started hearing sounds of little twigs being crumbled and snapped.  I grabbed the flashlight and panned left to right,  As I got almost directly out in front of me about 60 feet out in the woods I came across a pair of eyes eight feet off of the ground.  The eyes were the size of golf balls,further apart than humans.  The color of the eyes were blue,and the pupils were fully open and i could see the whites of the circumference.then the eyes disappeard.  I then ran over and woke my friend up again.  I said there is something out there in the woods.  My friend sat up looked around half dazed about 5 minutes and then passed out again.   It was 1:45 am.  I then shined the flashlight back in the woods looking for what ever owned them eyes, but to no avail.  I now gave up on my friend for help.  I then sat there and listened for more sounds.  At 2:08 am I heard loud crashing foot steps coming from the right side of the woods down the hill in front of me.  I grabbed my camera and pointed it towards the sound and snapped a picture.  Then the stepping noise would stop for about 5 minutes at a time.  Then it would start again and I would count about 5 steps and snap another picture in the direction of the sound and it would stop again.  This went on for about 40 minutes.  What ever started walking from the right of me was now to the left of me up on the hill.  The sound of the foot steps was like a huge thing moving thru the woods.  You could literally hear twigs and branches snap as each foot hit the ground.  It was a horrible sound.  I was realy scared now.  It got deathly quiet.  It was now 3:00 am.  Then out to the left of the overhang where I heard the tree branch snap earlier in the evening, there came this voice of something trying to talk or comunicate by mimicking human language.  It was saying 'mark roc roc, mark roc roc\" over and over six times in a deep low voice.  This went on for 5 minutes.  I was terrified at this point.  Then it got quiet again.  At 3:30 am what ever was out to the left of me ,was now directly above me on top of the overhang.  There came three deep grunts. kind of deep grunts you would hear an alligator make down in the swamps of the south.  The grunts were low and deep.  At that time, I turned the volume up to the highest setting on the stereo then turned it on for about a minute.  Then I turned it off and listened .  I did not hear any thing for another 20 minutes.  Then all of the sudden there came this huge sneeze.  It then coughed 2 times.  The sound of the cough was deep lunged, like a horse or a rhinoceros.  This was still on top of the overhang where this came from.  The smoke from the fire was rising in the direction of the coughing.  I think the thing was trying to get a wiff of us or something, instead it got a wiff of smoke.  At this time I turned on the stereo and let it play for about 5 minutes.  I wanted this thing to just go away.  Then I turned off the radio and listend but I did not hear any thing.  Then all of a sudden came this crash of lightning.kaboom then it started to rain real heavy.  All I could hear was rain drops hitting the leaves on the forest floor.  I then started pacing back and forth with my gun praying for the sun to rise.  It rained for about 2 hours.nothing else happend untill the sun came up.  My friend finally woke up at 8:30 am.  My friend looked at me and said why are you walking back and forth for?  and I said we had company last night.  My friend said I thought you were joking with me.  I said why would I wake you up twice in the night and say that i am scared and something was out in the woods for no reason.  My friend said I don't know!  I told my friend to watch my back as I ran out in the woods to look around.  I did not see any thing untill i went up the trail to the left of camp.  I found this tree that used to be 12 feet tall.  At 8 foot high on the tree trunk was this snap break.  The thickness of the tree was 4 inches in diameter.  Then the tree was pulled down to within a foot of the ground.  At that time my friend came to the tree and said what did that?  I then said I told you we had company last night.  Then my friend got close to the ground and said oohhh what is that smell?then I got close to the ground and said oohh what is that smell also.   The smell was that like rotten vomit, very putrid it made you want to vomit from the smell.  Then we saw these marks on the ground by the tree.they were 7 feet apart markings on the ground. like what ever was there had 7 foot gait to it's walk.  I then followed the markings on the ground that led directly to the top of the overhang.  At that point I found flies on the ground at the spot where I heard the grunts and cough.  I got down and sniffed the spot that the flies were at and it was the same putrid smell as the one by the tree.  I then found one spot going up the hill that was a footprint of the front of the toes.the toes were probably an inch wide each and in line together unlike a humans front toes that are angled.  There was 5 toes in all.  I took a picture of the print along with a picture of the trashed tree.  At this point I am convinced that bigfoot had been the visitor during the night.  Me and my friend went back to camp to eat breakfast and discuss what we have found.  We decided that we would do a survey of the area.  Way on top of the hill that is probably a quarter of a mile to the top we found that on top of the hill there is a gas line right of way.  Probably 20 yards wide and miles long. The grass was thick and 3 to 4 feet high.  We found an opening up there on the opposite side that was 8 feet high and 5 feet wide going into those woods.  It looked like something big was moving in and out of those woods for some time.  We went in a little ways but then we decided to go back to camp.  It was too dark in there and it was the middle of the day.  We sat around camp and gatherd up more wood for the nights fire.  After our evening meal my friends girlfriend showed up with their dog.  We told her nothing about what happend last night.  The dog ran around about an hour then it was tired.  The dog and my friends girl friend went to sleep in the tent at 9:00pm.  I told my friend to put on some coffee that you got the watch.  I need some sleep.  I have been up for too long now.  I laid down at 10:00pm.  I was just about to sleep when out to the right side of the hill came this thing running at least 35 miles per hour.  At that time I was up with a flashlight looking down hill for what ever was running thru the woods.  It was like a train moving non stop until the sound disapeared to the left.  My friend looked at me and said what was that?  I told him that was what had visited last night.  He was surprised at the sound.  Then I got me some coffee this was going to be another long night.  At 12:00am the thing came running from left to right.  Same thing at 35 m.p.h..then at 1:00am it came running down from top of the hill to the bottom of the hill.  Then that was it for the night.  My friend went to sleep in the tent with his girl friend at 2:30am.  I stayed up all night again fighting sleep. I was wondering why this thing would come running by camp.  Then it dawned on me, it smelled the dog and probably was trying to lure the dog out to get an easy meal.

My brother and I were shocked to see him, just standing out in the middle of our yard looking the other way. We heard about it before and our very first thought was that he might attack us. I told my brother to start reaching for a stick under the deep snow so we can defend ourselves. The Bigfoot was probably about 30 feet away from us. It stood nearly straight up, but with a little hunch. Its height was around 6 1/2 feet tall with a build similar to a human frame. The Bigfoot long brown hair on him, but not too thick as it was possible to see some skin under his fur. As were trying to pull out the stick from the snow, the Bigfoot heard the noise and quickly turned around and looked at us in the eyes. At that time, I was very scared. Our hearts were racing and we were shaking. For about five seconds or so he stared at us and we at him. His facial feature looked like a mix between a human and an ape. He didn't have more of a flatter face but slightly darker colored and thick skinned like an ape. After the stare down, it suddenly turned around and with super human abilities ran around the house in a just a few seconds at the most. The snow was deep, but it ran down our property and took a left turn around the house. It was like the snow never existed as he moved so quickly. I was totally amazed how lighting quick he was. It took huge long steps....that convinced us we saw a Bigfoot. Even if someone was playing a trick on us, there is no one in this world that can run through deep snow in a matter of seconds. This was the convincing point for us. But it's not over. After my brother and I made it back to the house, we yelled for our parents, but of course they didn't believe us at all. Two boys watching monster movies, yeah right... who would believe us! But later that night we heard him again. But this time he was walking on the porch around our house. I heard the snow smashing down as it walked on our porch....crunch, crunch, crunch.. and so on until it stopped right behind my window. We had bunk beds and I was on the top and my brother on the bottom. There was a small push window immediately behind my head, I could feel its presence behind me. I think (but are not sure), it was looking in the window at me. I had sooo many goose bumps on my body, I just jumped out of my bed as quickly as possible thinking he was going to ram his hand through the window to drag me out. As I ran out my brother also followed me and we raced into the living room where our dad always falls a sleep at night on the couch. We yelled that Bigfoot was out there again and of course Dad told us to go back to bed and quit fooling around, it was past our bed time. We kept yelling to him that we were serious, so he got up and looked out the sliding doors. He couldn't see anything outside and told us to go back to bed. We were too scared so we sleep in the living room on the floor. My brother and I never thought about going back outside that same day we saw Bigfoot and look for footprints. Everybody asks us that, but it just never dawned on us to do that. As the years roll by the images and details get more sketchier in my mind. But I am 100% convinced we saw him that day. The solid evidence for me is that he ran through that deep snow in just a few seconds. I'm a fairly serious runner and I know for a fact, that is totally impossible to run through the snow that quick. Bigfoot reminds me of a Heron Bird, you can never get too close to it and it quickly takes off to hide. With the woods and parks by the house and Nelson ledges somewhat close by, I think he maybe hiding in at Nelson Ledges in the caves in the ground. But that's just a hunch. Personally, I have a hard time believing myself at times, because I do not believe in evolution, but at the same time I am absolutely positive I saw him. I don't think we are going to ever find him unless we directly go out looking for him. So many people tell me they don't believe in it because no one has ever found a dead Bigfoot in the forest. But I say that it's just like the many animals in the world, we don't see them laying all around the yard either. If we found Bigfoot though, it sure would be the catch of the century! The world would change dramatically if we were able to study them closely.

I was around 13 years old and my best friend was 12.  We had been badgering our parents for walkie-talkies for a couple years because we used to play in the woods so often.  Much to our delight, my friend's father was cleaning out their attic and found a set left by the previous owners of the house.  He cleaned them up, got us new batteries and we were on our way. There were very few houses in our area at the time and plenty of wooded areas to play.  We headed down to where a new road was being cut.  The crews had basically ploughed a rough dirt \"road\" almost 1/2 a mile into the dense forest off of our road.  We got almost to the end when we headed back into the woods (west).  We started heading toward the direction of an old quarry that had been abandoned for many years.  We had gone in about 100 yards when we agreed to start walking in opposite directions, but parallel to the \"road\", so we could test the range on the walkie-talkies. We were alternating our responses for about 40-50 yards when my friend stopped responding.  I could still see him in the breaks of the foliage, so after several attempts to reach him via the walkie-talkies, I just called out to him.  He came back across the radio and told me not to shout or move.  I asked him what was happening and he told me to be very still because he saw something behind a large tree that had fallen about another 40 yards further in.  It had just stormed about a week earlier and many trees in the woods had fallen.  This particular tree had its roots exposed, but was still suspended, on the \"leaf-end\", about 3-5 feet above the ground due to a tangle of vines.  He said that he could \"feel\" the \"something\" watching him and he was scared to move.  I told him that I didn't see anything and I would walk towards him.  He warned me again not to move and said that the \"thing\" was shifting its weight and started moving toward \"my end\" of the tree.  I stood there looking at the root disk and suddenly saw what appeared to be a dark face and broad shoulders.  I too could \"feel\" this \"thing\" watching me.  The creature, if you will, moved back and forth as if studying my friend and me.  The height was undiscernable, but had to be above six feet tall.  It was hard to see the legs, but those also appeared to be dark in colour.  After about 5 minutes of this \"thing\" alternating vantage points, I had enough and was ready to make a dash for the road.  My friend reluctantly agreed to move toward the spot we started while keeping an eye on the fallen tree.  We finally met up and began to back up.  We had only gotten a few yards when we saw the creature rise up and put its hands on the trunk by the root-disk.  My friend and I screamed at full volume and started to run for the \"road\".  We turned only once after hearing a loud crack of wood, possibly a branch or something underfoot, to see this creature running almost noiselessly in the opposite direction.  It, again, was very difficult to see, but appeared to be completely black, powerfully built and running on two legs.  We ran all the back home and said we would keep this incident between us.  A few days later, my friend's father said he had read an article in the Geauga Times Leader (a local paper) stating a woman in a nearby town had seen a Sasquatch.  We asked what a \"Sasquatch\" was and his dad laughed, saying it was a cross between an ape and a man and it wasn't real.  We read the article and it sounded exactly like what we had seen!  My friend's older brother said that he had heard something following him along the Chagrin River as he was going to a friend's house a week before and joked that it might have been the same thing as what was reported in the newspaper article.  I never spoke of this incident until I was into my adulthood and had moved out of the area.

The first was at a campground about 20 years ago by Mohican state park (Ohio).  I left the campfire to check on the kids. We were camping with a few other families and the tents were basically in a circle.  As I passed the tent next to mine there was what i take to be a young bigfoot (about my height, which is 5'7\") I would call it grayish brown, not like an ape, the facial features were flatter, more like a person's (not the big jaw an ape has). I stopped dead in my tracks and it stared at me and I stared at it. It frightened me since I didn't expect to see it but it never moved, giving me the impression it was just as scared. I went back to the fire and it disappeared. The second time was two nights ago.  It has been very hot the last few days so I was staying up later to do wash and put it in the dryer.  It was about 11:45 pm I was loading the dryer and glanced up at the open window to see a head and shoulders and the top of the back walking past the window. The window is about 6 feet off the ground so I guess it was roughly 7 feet tall.  It evidently bumped into something on the way because it knocked into the house. Personally I hate seeing it.

I knew that many sightings had occurred after rainfall.  One night last August, after a day of bad storms that ended by evening, on a whim I decided to drive to this park at night.  It was an eerie night with distant lightning flashes in the sky.  There\u2019s a road that leads to a parking lot.  At one point the road sharply veers to the right into the parking lot.  If you were to go straight, you would be driving down a private drive. As I turned down this road, looking straight ahead down this private lane, I saw big eyes looking back at me.  There was one set of very large, close together, blue-white eyes high off the ground.  They almost looked cartoonish in shape, they were so large.  They were oval and sort of cocked toward each other like a cartoon figure.  They were totally unthreatening looking \u2013 in fact, my impression was of a gentle and frightened creature.  Halfway down this large creature I saw several smaller blue-white eyes.  I never saw a \u201cpair\u201d, though.  They were just random blue-white dots in several places halfway down the creature.  When I first saw the eyes, I stopped my car and just stared in disbelief.  The eyes didn\u2019t move for several seconds.  Then the tall big-eyed creature\u2019s eyes started to sway back and forth.  When it did that, the shorter eyes all started to move, appearing and disappearing and moving around in a smooth and floating manner.  I never saw figure shapes or fur.  Just eyes.  When everything started moving, I panicked unfortunately, turned my car around and got out of there as fast as I could.  What can I say?  I\u2019m a female and I was alone at night in a park looking at strange eyes.  I went to my sister\u2019s house 10 minutes from there and told her about it.  She got her son and his girlfriend, and the four of us went back to the sighting area to explore it with flashlights.  We saw nothing \u2013 no prints or sounds or smells.  However, it was a noisy night insect wise, but when we walked in the sighting area, it was eerily quiet.  Two things I noticed.  By seeing my nephew and sister in the same spot where I saw the eyes, it was apparent that the adult creature was much taller than they are.  Also, I was able to clearly see my relatives\u2019 shapes and clothing.  I couldn\u2019t see the creature\u2019s shape, so it (they) must have been very dark from top to bottom.

All I can say is that after what I saw and heard, I have to support the other person that made a report because I have to back them up. In mid May, 2013, I was returning from Buckeye Deli in Nashville Ohio on a deserted back road, (TR211 on my way to CR22).  It was early dusk because I wanted to get some cigarettes at the store before it got dark.  I stopped for several minutes to take pictures of some horses on the side of the road.  I was listening to live Grateful Dead,\"Two From the Vault,\" on the Ford Expedition's CD player. I was enjoying thinking about being off work from traveling this summer, and appreciating this beautiful place that we call home.  The road is very scenic.  There is a canopy of trees which makes it cool to drive through in the hot summer.  The road cuts through a hill on the left and a ravine on the right. There are no guard rails and it is a dirt road. You don't travel this road in the winter if it is snowy and icy.  There are a few houses and farms nearby but mostly it is just wooded and remote.  Just locals for the most part go by every now and then.  So after several minutes of nature watching, (I have three photographs), I decided to go forward and as I put the car into gear, about 250 feet ahead of me I saw a big black creature leap from the hillside into the ravine.  I said outloud to myself, \"What the hell was that?\"  I made a mental note to watch for deer, as we all do around here, but then I got thinking about what I saw. It was definitely black or dark colored.  Since it was filtered light I realized that it couldn't be a deer that was sillhouetted dark, because the sun wasn't right for that. There was a cover of trees. I went back another day at the same time and confirmed it with my brother-in-law and husband. So after I saw it, I got nervous because I believed that I may just have seen real sasquatch! I have seen the TV show a couple of times, but didn't really think about it much.  I drove forward to where I saw whatever it was cross the road, (arms / front legs in the air, big body lower, leaping into the woods), and didn't see anything after that. I can't say how big it was.  It fits the profile looking back in my mind now.  I remember at the time thinking at first that I saw a deer, and that it was a very big deer, (the kind that people would be proud to get around here in season), and that I should watch out on my way home. Then I started thinking about what I saw, and knew that it wasn't a deer.  I have to admit going down the road a bit that after a cursory glance, looking for whatever I saw...I kind of wanted to get the heck out of there.  I called my sister-in-law on my way back to tell her that I think I saw a sasquatch, (she likes to joke about sasquatch stuff).  She can verify that I was a little shaken up by it.  I was still reeling when I got home a few minutes later, still on the phone with her, and reported it to my husband.  After a few minutes discussion, he said that it was probably a bear, which I was OK with. I thought about it for awhile that night and went on to other things.  After several days, (it was still on my mind), I decided to look online to see if there was any other reports out there for Holmes County, Ohio.  After a google search, I found BFRO and read the report from June 2012 for that very same area!  That blew me away because we are in a very rural area in the middle of nowhere.  What were the chances of having a report HERE!  So I started to think that maybe it was a sasquatch.  I sent an e-mail to BFRO and got a call the next morning from the Ohio investigator.  He sounded very credible to me, and while I was rushing around getting ready for a job interview, I had to tell him what I saw. He blew me away when he told me that there have been several reports from my area in the past 6 months.  Now I was really concerned that this might be real.  Word went out to our family about my possible squatch sighting, and this past Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, my brother-in-law came down for a visit because everyone else was out of town.  So the three of us re-traced my steps down TR211 about the same time of day so I could verify that the light would not make a deer look black.  I have the three pictures of horses from where I was parked when I saw it.  We matched up the area and took another look. We stopped where we thought that it crossed before the bend in the road, looked over, and noticed that the fence was bent.  There was no fur stuck to it. There was a black thing on it but we didn't think it was fur.  Maybe I should go back and look again! lol My brother-in-law said that the area looked squatchy.  There was a canopy of trees, hills, a stream, wildlife and seclusion. Here's the best part of the story... On Sunday of Memorial Day weekend a few weeks after my sighting, we made a big warm bonfire because it was in the mid 30s and we wanted to be outside to celebrate the unofficial first weekend of summer regardless of the cold. My husband went to bed, and my brother-in-law and I decided to turn off the music and listen to the night sounds. It was about one o'clock in the morning. There is a lot of wildlife around here.  It was then that my brother-in-law let a really good squatch call rip, (like you hear on youtube).  And wouldn't you know it, we got a similar call back!  I looked and him and he looked at me, like did we really just hear that?  So he did it again, and sure as sh-- it came back even louder and clearer...then it trailed off.  I just about died.  We're like no way did that just happen!  I noted the time 0138.  We both said that it was one of two things, either someone else was messing with us, (there are campgrounds not too far away on the Mohican River), or it was a sasquatch.  I looked down the road and the distant neighbors did not appear to be out,  not surprising because it was really late and really cold. We heard it from the same direction on TR211 where I saw something a few weeks earlier. It was 35 degrees out and no one would be howling from a crowded campsite.  The calls definitely came from the general direction of Nashville. I can tell you that it did not sound human and was totally creepy!  Up until that moment, there were no answers to previous calls.  We had been having fun with it earlier in the day practicing our squatch calls.  But the two of us, without a doubt, heard those two calls.  It sent chills down our spines, and we know what we heard.  I made a new rule, that if anyone wants to call squatch, that we have to have tape rolling on it. We have lived here for 14 years and I have never been afraid of any animal life around here when I sit out late night watching the moon and the stars on our porch or by the fire. I am a night-owl and enjoy staying up late, sometimes until sunrise. It's a nice time to think, and to enjoy my beautiful surroundings when I don't have to get up early in the morning. It's an amazing place here in Drake's Valley as the original locals call it.  We call it home now since 1999 and never want to leave, even if there is a bigfoot nearby! Although I have to admit, this whole thing kind of freaks me out and I don't want to be scared of my surroundings. You move here for the glory of it all, not to be afraid of it.  Maybe this place just became more amazing to me and I should embrace it. This old farm house has been here for 138 years and we are surrounded by wilderness. You can't spend any time away from here because the wilderness will start to take it over, (squirrels, racoons, cardinals, wasps, mowing lawn for hours, cuyote, bees, birds, moles, tics, deer, bald eagles, fox, muskrat, cats, rooster, heron, hawk,snakes, grouse, geese, duck, bullfrog, possum, rabbit etc). We have it all down here...and now we have sasquatch possibly! My husband and I know that we are guests in these animals' home.  It's our home too though.  Somehow we will learn to live together...and maybe even communicate. In any case, I saw of glimpse of something and I heard something.  What it was / is, I don't  exactly know.  By the way, as I am typing this report, which takes a lot of guts to submit, on our porch two days after hearing the squatch call, with no music on, just sitting here enjoying the evening quietly for about 4 hours now, I just heard something at 0102.  It was a big tree knock!  SERIOUSLY!  Figures that would happen right now. If I hadn't started doing some more research, I might not have paid much attention to that type of sound.  I do pride myself on being able to idenify every night sound around here when my music isn't playing.  That one that I just heard was a real tree knock!  It sounded as if someone took a tree and banged it on another tree. I only heard it once now. I recognized it immediately from audio clips.  That was not too far away from me now!  I just called my sister-in-law.  It was in the opposite direction from where we heard the call Sunday. Maybe it's waiting around to see if my brother-in-law came back. There are 189 uninhabited acres from our back yard to the Mohican River. I heard it at 0102 in that direction.  I know all the sounds around here, and that was a darn tree knock. I also have to say that on Sunday, my we were playing Ohio squatch sounds on Youtube and I got a chill and said, \"I have heard that sound before.\"  I just wrote it off to cuyote, peacock or ferel cats.  I am usually playing music, but my first thought is that I have heard that sound before.  A cuyote cry, (or maybe a sasquatch cry), comes in over the music.  You hear a lot in this valley. I have found renewed motivation to send you this report now.  I don't know what is going on...we're just regular people.  I am not drunk.  And lol, I don't think that I am crazy!

Likewise, we had only lived in this house for the same amount of time. The incident occurred on a dry, warm day in early June (late spring). It was around 9:30 PM and I was having my last cigarette of the day before getting ready for bed. I preferred smoking in our garage which is on the backside of our house attached to the basement, directly facing the woods of the ravine. I sat in a chair while I smoked and noticed it was getting dark quickly. Within a minute or two from sitting down, I suddenly began to feel really uncomfortable and could not shake the sense of another presence or the feeling of being observed from the woods. I kept looking into the trees, but it was much too shadowy and dark to make anything out. I then began to feel very nervous and a strong sense of fear developed. My heart was beating rapidly, and I was in a state of extreme vigilance. I felt powerless and vulnerable. It was an awful, dreadful terrible feeling and I could not take it anymore and quickly extinguished my smoke, shut the garage door and went into the house. I immediately felt physically safer in the house, but mentally and emotionally I was still very shaken and upset. My concern now went for my wife, who was upstairs preparing for bed. I did not want her to be scared and decided not to tell her what had happened to me. We went about our routine and finally were in bed with the lights out shortly after 10:00 PM. We were having a conversation, and while my wife was speaking my attention was drawn to sounds coming from the open window in the back room of the house (facing the woods). This whole time I was still in shock from my experience in the garage. The sounds were faint at first and were strange. I thought I could make out words, maybe even hearing my name but it did not sound right or normal. My wife had not noticed the sounds yet and was still speaking when I asked her to be quiet and listen. She heard the sounds also which were becoming more bizarre and diverse. We got out of bed and went to the back bedroom window to have a better listen. It was now pitch black outside and we couldn't see anything. The sounds began to vary from short \"bird calls\"and babbling to the sound like an infant crying to a higher pitched human-like sounding voice to escalating screaming/screeching with an unbelievable volume. The sounds were extremely disturbing and seemed to be of a supernatural, ungodly nature. Around this time we noticed a flashlight beam coming from a neighbors house. When this happened, whatever was making the screams seemed to became super agitated and the screams were now in a frenzied state. At this point, even though looking out a second floor window, we felt fearful and unsafe and shut the window and went back into our bedroom. Shortly after, we heard nothing else. The whole incident lasted about three minutes. The next day I told my wife about what had happened to me when I went out for my last smoke of the day. This whole incident left us disturbed and spooked for days since we could not come to any explanation as to what could have made the sounds other than they were supernatural and possibly demonic. About a year ago I watched \"Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science\" and as soon a I heard the supposed Bigfoot vocalizations and realized that there were sightings all across the country I believed that the sounds we heard and the presence I encountered could very well have been a Sasquatch. I discovered the BFRO website and especially researched the Ohio information. Without telling my wife my newfound possible explanation of the origin of the sounds, I played the Ohio \"Scream\" for her. Instantly chills went down her spine and she said that sounds like what we heard in the back woods. She also believes it could have been a Sasquatch that made the sounds. To this day, we both are leery of being in the backyard after dark. I have been wanting to fill out this report for some time.

Weather was nice and clear, just the right temperature to take a leisure ride through the park. Even the wind was with us, blowing behind us and keeping the bugs off. Since we didn't have anything to do that day we thought we'd take a longer trail. It's a stand of white pines. Not the one that leads to a campground, but one adjacent to a field. I don't remember the color designation or the exact name, we call it the hangman's trail due to a tree, but it may be the whispering pines. I was deep in thought, not really paying attention to my surroundings. I turned to see if my mother was alright, seeing as she was quite a ways behind me. My gelding tensed, which instantly had me turning around to see what was wrong. My first impression was an object standing vertically. I figured a tree top had fallen down and was being propped up by a log. I waited for Goke to figure this out and settle. Boy was I wrong. It moved, we moved. Goke swirled around and went off at a dead run. He generally starts and stops, like running in place when he spooks. He stops, settles, and investigates. Even when a dog was attacking him he never ran so fast and so uncontrolled a gallop. He practically bulled over mom and her horse, and soon the mare was following and the two horses didn't stop until we were halfway back to camp. So whatever it was scared the shit out of him. While Goke was running I still had my head turned looking at the object. It ran off towards the field, whether it exited the forest or not I'm not quite sure, we entered the pines blocking my vision. A break in the forest directed sun in my face at the initial sighting, so more or less I got a blurred perception of the creature as we both changed position. But it was enough to tell me this was no deer or man. One, whatever it was ran upright. The proportions looked wrong for a man, bulk in the wrong place. Height was also an issue. We still use that trail and the landmarks are still there for comparison. Looking at the log it was standing behind I'd say it was 7-8 feet. It was dark, but the 'halo' around it made the edges appear a dark chocolate. Mom said I was white as a ghost and Goke was jittery for the rest of the ride.

Cross it and you come to a large island, which you go right off of into a small trickle of the creek and onto a rather stony bed. Which you cross another creek to a forested area full of hemlocks. There is (or was, I haven't gotten down there this year) an old tree with a phone set in the middle. If you see that, you're on the trail. You just follow the trail until you come to a fork. In front of you is a straight path, usually mowed, stating no tresspassing. The right is a trail I've never really been on, and the left is the trail to the pines. Naturally you want to go left.

(Land has since been sold to John Hancock Corp). This area is in the same general area as where my written report occurred. This area is used to grow soft pine trees for harvesting to grind into paper pulp. The total area is something around 800,000 acres. So you can imagine how big of an area this is. There are no homes or anyone living in this area at all, in fact you are not even allowed to build any permanent hunting cabins or such things. By this time of 1996 I had actually all but given up gun deer season, I was almost strictly a bow hunter. About 3 years before I was actually in a tree stand and had a bullet go over my head. Some idiot was out there somewhere (never seen him heard the shot but never seen the guy that pulled the trigger) anyway he was out there just taking pot shots. I had decided after that I would just stay with my bow hunting. However my buddy wanted me to go with him as he was alone, so I decided to go ahead and accompany him. The area that we camped in is an area that is very difficult to get to and rarely does anyone go into this area. You have to exit off a logging road and travel up this very steep clear cut that climbs up a small mountain. There is really not even a road as such that you have to travel along. At one time the loggers just took a dozer and cut a path the width of the dozer from the bottom of the mountain all the way up and then along the crest of the mountain. And this path is never maintained so it gets very rough and only a 4x4 can get through and even with that you have to drive at a speed little more than walking speed. This path travels about 3 miles and simply dead ends just at the start of the downward side of the mountain. Me and my buddy call it the dish. We call it that because you are traveling up this mountain in heavy forest make a curve then suddenly you are facing down and at the bottom is a area that very much resembles a satellite dish where it is void of trees and the concave shape of the ground gives the impression of a satellite dish. This clear area is about 30 feet or so in diameter. So anyway we make the journey up the mountain and take the treacherous path up to the dish. There we make our camp and it of course becomes our home away from home for the next few days. It was a bit odd this year because normally you see one or two hunting camps once you enter the area from the highway. But this time we seen not one camp or hunter. Now to take note the dish from the highway is 14 miles, now of course that is not straight line miles because you know how access and logging roads rarely run straight for any distance. On day 3 of our hunting trip we get up before daylight as usual and get ready to go out into nature and see if we find any deer. After all, that was why were there, even so I had seen nothing the previous two days but didn\u2019t really care because as usual I very much was enjoying myself with the flora and fauna. I am also very interested in geology and there is much to see in that area. To imagine that area at one time was a shallow sea never ceases to amaze me. I wish when I took my first geology course in college I would have changed my major and pursued that field further. Oh sorry there got off track didn\u2019t I\uf04a. We decide which directions we were going and we plan for our rendezvous back at the dish for 12 noon. We walk together for about \u00bd mile camp and there we split up my buddy continues to the west along the top of the mountain and I head south down the side of the mountain. Being that it was not yet daylight and these woods are very thick and dangerous to walk in during the daylight hours due to the rough rocky terrain I was not about to do any walking until first light so after we split I only walked about 10 yards or so and sat down and waited for a few more minutes until sun up. At sun up I get up and start my hunt, I normally am not a stalker for a couple of reasons to be a successful stalker you must have coordination to walk and not make noise also you really need a lot of stamina. I possess neither of those traits. So I normally hunt from some type of stand. But I had sat for several hours the evening before and was ready to move, plus I wanted to do some exploring into a saddle I had never been into before so this day I decided to stalk. NOTE: I am using the term \u201csaddle\u201d here and will continue using that term; however it really is not a saddle as such. A saddle is the gap between where 2 mountains run close together. This area is on the same mountain but it has two ridges (or fingers extending out away from the mountain) making a gap and valley in between these two parallel fingers much like a saddle. Imagine if you will, make a fist with your left hand, then after you make a fist extend your index and middle finger out like you are making the peace sign. Your hand is the mountain and your two extended fingers are these fingers that extend out from the mountain. The width of this finger is I am guessing somewhere around 150 yards, but could not see all the way through because of the trees (more on this further below). I will be walking down that eastern finger which in the above example would be your middle finger. Your index finger will be the western finger or ridge. (I hate using the term ridge it is too vague). The distance between these two fingers were only about 50 yards apart at the mountain and by the time you get out to the tips they are nearly a hundred yards apart. So the technically are not parallel either they do diverge some. And the length of the finger I am on is about 300 yards. The length of the western finger is about 370 yards. Never went up there so I have no clue how wide across it is. Also the crest of that finger is about 20 \u2013 30 yards higher than the one I am on. END OF NOTE I start walking down the mountain side and after about a half hour I reach the eastern finger of the saddle. I sit for a few minutes to rest and catch my breath before taking out down this finger of the saddle. On this finger I could view the saddle valley to my right and also could see the eastern side of the western finger of the saddle. From the top of the finger I was walking I could see very clearly down to the bottom of the saddle which was no more than 100 feet to the floor nearest the mountain and as you walked the top of the finger away from the mountain this finger sloped downward toward the valley so that by the time the finger ended the valley within the saddle was no more than 50 feet from the peak of the finger to the valley within the saddle. So from my 12 o\u2019clock position to 180 degrees to my right (clockwise) I had a totally unobstructed view. With the exception of the trees in the saddle valley. But I had a clear enough view that if a deer was in there or came through that valley there was no way I would miss seeing it. This particular course also gave me a good look at the western finger face although with many trees on it there were several spot that had no trees and the rock strata was exposed which would give me a chance to look at to see If I could distinguish the types of rock there. I could also watch the ridge top of the western finger and see anything coming over the top. Over to my right across the top of this finger is heavily wooded with mainly hardwoods however there were some pine trees among them. This is old growth trees some of the hardwood (oaks, hickory) are quite large. It is heavily wooded enough that even in the bright sun it is fairly dark in there only a few feet in. Not dark enough that you can\u2019t see but you certainly would not need sun glasses in there. It, just like up in the dish it gets dark in there long before the sun is fully set. There is very little under growth in this area because it is so sunlight challenged. And the spacing between trees are fairly wide so that if anything of any size moved through you would have no trouble sighting it. This tree line extends almost all the way to the edge of the finger. You would only have maybe 5 feet of space to walk the length of the finger clear of trees. From the edge of this finger I am on in some places are straight down into the valley below. The only way to get on this finger is from the direction I came or as I will speak to later would be from the very end or tip of this finger. So I slowly stalk down this finger, keeping just inside the tree line so as not to be exposed to the valley floor and the western finger. I stalk very slowly along in no hurry whatsoever. Understanding that stalking means walk a few steps stop, wait, and listen, and repeat. I stalk nearly the entire length of this finger and decide I need a break so I walk out of the tree line to a spot that is actually clear of trees (except for one tree about the diameter of basketball) for about an area the size of a large bedroom. There was this very fine looking stump there that actually looked like it was made for my fat butt and it was high enough that I did not even have to bend my knees very far to be sitting. I figured I would sit for a while and rest my tired legs then I would finish walking this finger all the way to the tip and look down it and into the valley across the way. Then head back because we were to hook back up at noon and by now it was 9:30 and I was a good 3 miles from camp and a very hard climb back up the mountain. (Why in the hell did I ever decide to walk down the damn mountain, I knew I would have to walk back up at some point)? As I was sitting on my fine stump I looked down the finger out to the tip. At the tip was a huge oak tree I am 5ft 10 and it would have took two of me to wrap my arms around this thing. As I was looking at this tree and trying to figure out how a tree can grow to that size in so little soil. I then notice just off to the right of this tree a figure walking up from below the tip of the finger. The figure was in bright sunlight so I immediately recognized it as walking on two feet. And he appeared to me to be walking with his head down. But my first thought was what a dumb ass. It is deer season and if you are in hunting you are required to wear blaze orange and this guy had none. Even if you are not hunting it is a good idea if you\u2019re out in the woods. Now granted I had only seen one human in 3 days and that was my hunting buddy. And even though there were no humans for miles I for one would never take a stupid chance like that. I guess I should mention also that during the deer gun season, logging operations cease and the loggers go home. The company\u2019s do not want their employees getting plugged by some knucklehead hunter. So I knew that this guy was not a logger. Then the next question came to my mine how in the hell did this guy get there? There is no logging road in that direction for a very long way. And from the nearest road it is a long ass haul to that point. And that haul would not be easy at all in fact that area is inaccessible even by an ATV. The next thought no he is not a hunter he is not carrying a rifle nor does he have one slung on his shoulders. Now remember that all these thoughts were processed in my head in a matter of micro-seconds. While this guy was walking slowly up this slope to the top of this finger that I am on. Then the next though through my mind gosh that is a cone head (from the movie) with hair. Because his head was very pointy. Next thought my god those are big assed shoulders. Next thought why in the hell is he wearing a mink coat? WTF. Next thought did god forget to give this guy a neck? It looked to me as his head was attached directly to his shoulders. Then this guy finally reaches the top and stands directly besides that big oak I was looking at just moments ago. Next thought my god that is one big MF. I have seen many football games and some of those have been up in the nose bleed section and those guys even that high up look big. But this was different I am now 83 yards from this guy and he is the biggest person I have ever seen bar none. Then the big guy looks up and looks directly at me out in front of god and everyone. It was then I realized ok I am not looking at any man but not really animal either it didn\u2019t seem. Now let me attempt to explain what big guy did. Imagine yourself standing looking straight ahead at some target and right next to you and slightly in front of you to your right is a big tree. Your desire now is to get behind that tree with little movement as possible. What you would most likely do is simply lift your left foot and pivot 90 degrees counterclockwise on your right foot with your head and neck froze in place to watch your target while moving. That is what he done. Next thought do I have any clean underwear back at camp cause me thinks I need them. Then the flight or fight response kicked in on me but I forced myself to stop think and evaluate. I determined that at 83 yards (didn\u2019t know it was exactly 83 yards at that time I went and marked off the distance later)(I was actually guessing at the time 100 yards)there was no way no matter how fast he was, that he could cover that distance before I put at least 3 bullets in him. (However I thought later than may have only pissed him off as big as he was). But anyway when I assured myself there was no real danger I calmed down and started thinking clearly again. The big guy was now standing behind that oak watching me then suddenly he popped behind the tree and I couldn\u2019t see him. So at that point I very slowly got up and moved behind that little tree near me. Then I peeked around that basketball sized tree (BTW at that time I was beach ball size so you can see the tree really offered no concealment) to see what was happing. By the time I looked back up he was once again peeking out from behind the tree. Now this time I thought that poor guy is deformed somehow because there appeared to be some kind of growth just around and below his throat. Could not make it out but definitely could see the discoloration and could see that there was something there that didn\u2019t belong. I was straining as hard as I could to make out the facial figures of this guy but try as I might there was simply no way I could make out any details of his face. My one real regret in this whole experience. Anyway we just kind of stared at each other for a couple of seconds then he popped back behind the tree. So I done the same the best I could. Here I am in an area with trees the size of Volkswagens and leave to me to pick a sapling to hide behind. After a couple of seconds behind the tree I pop out my head don\u2019t see him but I stay in that position a couple of more seconds then the big guy pops out his head again and looks at me. Now I am really confused because the growth that seemed to be on his throat is now over on top of where a clavicle would be. I don\u2019t know what is going on it is just too far away for me to make out fine detail. Someone with better vision probably would have been able to make things out better. Now here it becomes surreal and I don\u2019t know if I can put into words the way the situation seemed to instantly change. One moment I am so tense you could not have driven a straight pin up my butt with a 16 lb sledge hammer. The very next second a calm came over me and somehow I just had a feeling that there was nothing to be concerned about. So while he was looking at me I purposely leaned my rifle up against the stump I was just sitting at with him watching me. I just got the distinct feeling (yes I know the least scientific thing in the world) that he knew that I meant no harm and had no intention of doing anything to him. Maybe not maybe I am just reading more into that than I should. For lack of a better word we basically played peek-boo for another two minutes popping back and forth behind the trees. I just got a feeling he would have liked to have gotten a closer look at me just like I wanted to with him. Of course that was never going to happen. I think we may have kept doing that for a while longer but something happened that changed the circumstance. After a total of just about 3 minutes he very suddenly snaps around the other direction? I was thinking what the heck. Then I heard what he heard very large SNAP coming from the woods on top of this finger. I peed. Then the big guy turns and keeping the tree between me and him he simply walks off. He did not run or even walk particularly fast, he was walking a bit faster leaving than he did walking in but not in any panic. I figured if it was something that made him want to leave the area I better figure out quick what that made that noise. So I pick up my rifle and immediately start scanning. I want so badly to walk over to the tip to see if I can a glimpse of big guy. But I don\u2019t dare until I resolve this issue. After a couple of minutes of searching and listening to the noise I finally track to the source of the noise maker. A frigging tank rat. Damn I missed a possible chance to get a better look at big guy because of a dang tank rat. (Don\u2019t bother looking that species up that is my personal term for an armadillo). As stated above after the incident I walked off the distance and also solved one of the mysteries. The abnormal growth on big guy was not on big guy at all. It was on the tree it was a viral knot about the size of softball. I am 5\u2019 9/10, standing under the knot I could barely touch the bottom edge of the knot with my fingers standing on my tip toes and arm extended as far as I could. I found no tracks what so ever even though I knew the exact location of where he walked up and back from, but the ground was hard pan and even a D9 bull dozer would have been hard pressed to leave any marks/tracks in that ground.", "location_details": "Can show on a topo map", "county": "McCurtain County", "state": "Oklahoma", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 25703: Experienced hunter decribes a brief standoff at approx. 80 yards, in daylight, near Smithville", "latitude": 34.36778, "longitude": -94.68028, "date": "2009-03-25", "number": 25703.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "9yhet2ryvd", "temperature_high": 64.62, "temperature_mid": 54.225, "temperature_low": 43.83, "dew_point": 43.16, "humidity": 0.79, "cloud_cover": 0.31, "moon_phase": 0.96, "precip_intensity": 0.0147, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1012.01, "summary": "Rain in the evening.", "uv_index": 8.0, "visibility": 8.04, "wind_bearing": 103.0, "wind_speed": 0.95, "location": "POINT(-94.68028000000001 34.367779999999996)"}, {"observed": "Hunting in the woods, I saw what I at first thought was a deer but it turned out to be an elk (rare to spot in the area).

My husband and I had just put our oldest son to bed, and were settling down to watch TV in our living room.  My husband heard \"someone\" screaming \"bizarrely\", very loud far off across our lake, so he opened our back sliding door to get a better listen.  That was when we both heard a, maybe 3 at a time, organized pattern of what can only be described as roaring screams. We knew immediately they were not human.   I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same.  This animal was closer, just across a 6 acre or so lake/pond. We heard probably a total of 4, 3-at-a-time, scream patterns. The individual screams were alarmed, but not frantic.  It seemed to be almost 'responding' to dogs barking.  The 'runs' were all about .5 - 1 second apart.  The interval in between patterns was probably 1 minute or so. All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog. At the end of the tussle the dog let out a sharp yelp and we heard a thud.  At that point we (I flipped out) shut the door, locked all the doors, sawed a serious dowel for our back slider, turned on our kids white noise machines and went to listen from another part of the house.  We heard a few more screams but it sounded farther away at this point and then seemed to go away. Whatever tangled with that dog was extremely fast, extremely large and very strong.  Based on what we heard, it sounded like the creature must have either approached or walked past a tied up dog.  We heard a quiet small scuffle probably as the dog tried to bite it.  Then an enormous amount of thudding, bushes rustling, and a loud pained yelp and a thud. All was quiet after that and we heard some quiet splashing in the lake.  The splashing could have been disturbed waterfowl, however.  It was pitch black and we were looking out our back sliding doorway into the blackness basically just trying to listen when this occurred.  The tangle with the dog occurred about 3 minutes after we heard the vocalization pattern.  In total, the vocal pattern seemed to be moving slowly from the northwest end of the lake to the northeast end, where we believe the dog incident occured. I have a BS in zoology from the University of Washington and a considerable amount of outdoors experience.  I have heard all different types of animal calls, screams, etc... I'm even quite good at discerning the subtle differences between a Beluga whale click and a porpoise call. I have perfect pitch and a well trained ear from years of classical voice training.  This was most certainly a primate type call, almost with a Siamang type quality to it. It was most definitely not human, and I'm certain it was not any other animal common around our area (coyote, deer screaming in pain, rabbit, fox, racoon, other).  It was extremely similar to the Klamath falls recording only louder and closer, and it scared me more than anything I've ever encountered.  My husband and I discussed our observations at length.  There is honestly no other explanation for this type of call and activity, though we understand how rare and extraordinary this must be because we live in a settled area near freeways and quite honestly we've never really considered \"bigfoot\" before much more than \"what a neat theory!\" Let me just state again that this was not human.  Not even close. Even a human trying to imitate something like that would have had a 'narrower', more nasal sound as a human just doesn't have the head/throat size to accomplish such volume and tone.  Further, it had a squeal and roar quality at the same time, like nothing I've ever heard except the various recordings, in particular the Klamath.  Also a human scream would have had some identifiable emotion to it (drunk, scared, angry etc...) as humans we're quite good at picking up on tones of other humans.  This had none of that.  It was entirely foreign to us. Update: this morning as I look through my binoculars across the lake, exactly where we heard the dog tussle incident, the neighbor's canoe dock is destroyed.

During this time I was working, living as a resident of the Portland Job Corps, which is located on the banks of the Sandy River, which enters the Columbia River at Troutdale, Or. The camp which is about 4.5 miles up the Sandy, I'd say, where the students live and worked at the time. I'm not sure if the camp is still there or not. The Sandy River takes a turn to the south [at the confluence with a small tributary] and goes up into the westside of Mount Hood. This is where the camp is located. The kids or students who lived and worked there were able to cut holes in the fence and play and explore in the woods, which we did. There was a path that led to the place called The Falls, which was about a half mile from the camp where a lot of students would go to hang out party etc. On the way to the camp was a structure the kids had made. I remember one of the people who constructed it. He was Jim Hinkly, an Indian, whom I knew to be a likeable sort of guy. It was nothing more than a framework made of poles or cut trees about three or four inches in diameter, put roughly into a big lean-to, using trees for support,  covered with plastic to keep the rain off of us while we sat and smoked chatted etc. This place was used on a daily basises for a couple of weeks or so and every thing was cool till one afternoon, Jim came into the welding shop and told me someone or thing had destroyed the shack. Strange, I thought. So as soon as class was out, I went over to look at it. There was a structure about ten foot deep by about fifteen feet wide, nothing more than trees lashed to the standing trees to make a full roof basically at a slight angle to shed water to the back. The place had a strong smell, very bad, and the place was a wreck. The main trees/poles that formed the roof were broken in two, snapped like toothpicks. I'd personally hung on them many times and they hardly swayed under my weight. Chairs, broken metal, I might add, and the table broken like someone had hit it in the middle of it and broke it. There was hair around the trees also but no one thought to gather; it reddish in colour, about three inches long. The main things were the smell and the fear a person felt when close to the area. I'd say this was in August or September. The next one was probably in October or November. A group of us was out back above the football field at night partying with the full moon. It was cool and foggy, with the fog moving quickly and low to the ground so the moon was seen but the landscape would be changing - sort of a nice night; the hill, a gradual one, was covered with long grass and we were having a good time with lots of noise, carrying on, probably a group of 8-12 kids, me being one. I would have been about 19 at this time, as were most of the others also. The party was going on when all of a sudden the entire group went dead quiet at the same time. We sort of all started looking around at each other and Martin, who was an Alaska Indian, standing next to me, said: \"What is that?\"  Through the fog one could see the form of a large biped close to us, about 30-50 yards away, in the fog. We saw it long enough to know it was not a human, too big, too muscular. I'm a hunter, also have been that from the time I was 6, raised in the woods. I know bear, deer, elk etc., none of the above was what we saw. With the fog moving, it was an eerie scene as the thing would be visible, then fade and then show again. The moon was behind it, so it was a shadow that showed up fairly easily when the fast moving fog didn't obscure it from view. Martin said \"Let's go see what it is\". I said, ok, a couple of girls screamed, and we took off toward it and the  girls and some of the guys took off the other way. What happened next was interesting. As we were moving toward the spot where we last saw it - briskly, I may add, I in the lead,  all of a sudden I couldn't go any futher. My feet wouldn't move and as the fog moved away, it was about the same distance away, looking at us. Martin was close to me and as I turned to look where he was exactly,  when we looked again it was gone in the fog. Total time elapsed was only about one to two minutes from the time we first saw it to the time that it was gone. We moved probable only 100 feet before we couldn't go any farther. The third event happened that winter in a snowstorm - a bad snow storm, I might add. The camp had been stranded for about two days and it had been snowing steadily. It was about 7-9pm. I was dorm leader at this time. Two of the students came in the back door and both where white and moving fast. I said: \"What is wrong with you guys?\" One said nothing and another wouldn't say anything, either. Part of my job as dorm leader was to look into things like this so I followed them to their bunks and lockers where I got one - I forget his name - to admit that they were outback smoking on the football field when something scared the hell out of them. Rocky, the other person, wouldn't say much, just was white and scared. The other kept saying something out is there. Me being the fool I am, said \"Bull\" and headed upstairs to get my coat and boots on and headed out into the snow storm to the football field to find out what was up. Too much snow, about waist deep - I'm 6'2\" tall -  for a  cougar etc. to be wandering around, I thought. So I headed out across the football field, being the brave fool I was. Things were going well until about 20 to 30 yards from the edge of the field, where the physical training stations were located. This camp used to be an FBI training camp, I was told, and it had a track and training stations around the football field and farther down the hill towards the creek where the road and the town of Troutdale sat. As I said, things were going well until about that far from the edge, when I suddenly couldn't go any further forward. It was not that I didn't want to; I couldn't and in the flying snow I kept being drawn to a large clump of blackberry bushes below the situp station. So I stayed there and played with the feeling. I could back up and it went away, I would come forward and it was present. Strange, I thought. I had a feeling about what I was feeling and what created it. No one else wanted to come out and play from the dorm. They thought I was nuts so I stayed for a while and then went back as it was snowing hard.  I won't fill out much more of the details below except name and contact info. If you like I'd tell you the same thing I basically told here. A long time has passed and although I still remember it, I don't know where anyone else is or even if the camp is still in operation. This is in response to reading the Locals book which I found quite interesting and it is something else to add to you list of sightings. The one thing I found most interesting was the inability to move any closer in both situations and the definitive line  where this happened.

I left Portland at 3 am and had only had coffee and donuts to eat; there were not many other cars on the road at all, none that were going in a westerly direction that were within sight of me and only about 2 cars passed me between Spirit Mountain Casino and the site were I had my sighting. I was driving about 55 mph and had my bright lights on  and had just came over a rise in the road shortly after you start down the back side of Murphy Hill summit. As I crested the rise out in the distance I saw what I thought at the time was a deer on the left shoulder of the road about 200 yards out from me.  I slowed down to 40 mph or so because I didn't want it to jump in front of me or if there were other deer in the area I might spook them into the road. As I got within 75 yards the object began to move across the road from left to right, that is, when I saw that it was not a deer and I thought it might be a bear which I have seen cross a road before but this was way different. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps. The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches. The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area. I did not see the face except for there seemed to be a deer-like shine coming from the face area. The height was about 7ft + as it disappeared over the edge of the road to the right. I was about 50 yards away by this time. I was starting to feel pretty weird like this was something I had never seen. Hard to explain the feeling as I passed the spot where it went over the bank I tried to look over and see where it had gone. I was going about 25 mph now as I went about 20 yards past the spot and stopped I then reversed my car to the spot where I had seen it go over the bank. I stopped my car and left the engine running I had my window rolled down slightly for air flow as I was driving. When I stopped I could smell a musty type smell not real bad but strong enough to notice. I could hear some movement in the brush but not a lot because of the car noise and the fact that my window was only down 2 or three inches on the left side when the object was now on my right.  I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills. I decided then that it would be a really good time to leave so I drove off as fast as my Metro would go I made it to Lincoln City at 6 am and had about 10 cars pass me going east on hwy 18 in that time.When I got there I went to my girlfriend's to get my bag and was going to come right back to Portland to work. Instead I stayed until 9 am then left to go back to Portland. As I drove by the spot I thought about stopping but decided against it.  I know the area well though because I helped a lady who had rolled her car off the road in the same are many years ago. The bank in the are is about 7 ft down on both sides and is swampy in some places. I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this  I don\u2019t know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot.

My 12 year old daughter and I were sitting in the brush waiting for the rest of the party to push the elk to us.  We had been sitting in the dense trees since early in the morning (about 6 am) and it for about three hours, as my daughter wasn't keen on hiking through the canyon.  We had been bugling during the entire time.  Because it was early fall, it was quite foggy up in the high areas.  My daughter and I had been hearing what sounded like a branch thumping against the trees from down below us, but steadily approaching our hiding spot.  I thought nothing of the sound because one of the party was carrying antlers to \"rattle\" the elk.  Eventually, the two of us began to hear distinct rustling noises near us with a grunting and growling sound.  The stench was unbelievable.  It smelled like a combination of wet mop and wet dog hair that had moldered for awhile.  I have been around a bear carcass and it did not smell like this.  I was, quite frankly, spooked!  My daughter was likewise wanting to get out of the woods.  We immediately climbed up the canyon wall to where the four wheelers were.  The crashing sounds followed us.

I live in western Washington but grew up in Walla Walla and love the Blue Mountains. I\u2019m an avid hiker and love to enjoy the outdoors. When I get the time I like to make a hiking trip. I hadn\u2019t been to this particular site before but I had heard some of the Sasquatch stories coming out of the Tiger Canyon area. I had driven up Tiger Canyon a couple times before, including a few weeks prior in late June when the road was still blocked by snow. I thought this campground would be the perfect place to stay the night and hike the area. A friend of mine had been with on the trip when the road was blocked, but he too was busy this week so I went alone to scout out the area alone, stay the night and drive back to western Washington the next day. I had first been intrigued by the idea of Sasquatch when I found some info online while searching for hiking sites. As a kid some local friends had told me stories, but I\u2019d never been sure what to make of it. I also had read a book about Blue Mountain Bigfoot that Vance Orchard had wrote. I wasn\u2019t totally convinced that these creatures existed and did not think I would find anything about them because I figured that if there were encounters, they were very rare. I arrived at the campground at about one o\u2019clock. An older couple was there reading, enjoying the campground. I picked an area and began set up my tent. As I was pounding the stakes in I felt something hit the ground behind me. I turned around and I didn\u2019t see anything. I looked over at the couple and they were still sitting at their campsite. Whatever it was had caused a very strong vibration in the ground behind me and it couldn\u2019t have been anyone at the camp. A little bit later I started to hear a weird noise. At first I thought it was the antifreeze bubbling in my car because it was a hot day and my car was steaming a little. My car overheats a lot. The sounds were like a low rumbling growl. It was a sustained sound that lasted for just a couple seconds. However I seemed to hear it in regular intervals. The sound also seemed to kind of echo like the sound of something hollow or the sound of water down a drain which is why at the time I thought it was my car. I decided to explore the area; I walked by the two other campers and said hi. They had a poodle that barked at me little. I wanted to see if I could look over Tiger Canyon at the valley from where we were so I crossed over to the other side if Kendall Skyline Road. I couldn\u2019t see much through all the trees so I decided to head the other way. I brought a GPS device with me that had topography maps loaded on it. It showed a trail into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness that I wanted to follow. As I started in that direction I noticed a very large track just to the right of a pool of water in some soft mud. It didn\u2019t really look to me as something authentically Bigfoot because the foot seemed thin. I told myself it couldn\u2019t be a footprint of a Sasquatch because I had read some stories a few weeks earlier and thought I could just be imagining it. I came back and looked around the area behind the camp where I had felt the thump. I had heard something knocking on a tree so I tried to make noise like I had done when I was hammering the tent posts. I had a little pattern of sorts that I thumped onto the ground with a rock. It seemed like at one point whatever it was mimicked the pattern of my thumps. I explored the area I thought it was coming from, but only saw a deer, so I figured maybe it was just my imagination getting the best of me. The noises stopped and I felt relieved. \u201cIt was all just in my head\u201d I thought. It was now somewhere between 1:30 pm and 2 pm, and I started down towards Squaw Spring. I noticed some more prints as I walked but I still didn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. I found some that seemed to continue on further but I did not follow them since I had planned to go a few miles into the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and didn\u2019t want to waste time. It also looked like there was a foot impression on a log that had fallen across the spring. This all seemed too surreal to me because there were lots of prints everywhere even some that appeared smaller, possibly a juvenile animal, but they were just thin outlines. I had never seen prints like these in person so I was unsure what I was even looking at. I kept walking and came to a clearing on the side of a grade where I found a print that was about 3 inches deep and well defined. I could see the big flat foot, the toes and heel. Suddenly I thought wow these prints are for real. I now had a feeling one of these creatures could be around any corner. I got to the top of one of the mountains to get a nice view of the wilderness area and then made my way back to camp. When I got back I was pretty tired from hiking. The two other people at the campground left in their pickup shortly after I got there and I went to relax in my tent. I was the only one at the campground now. About an hour later I heard the same low rumbling growl sound from earlier. I realized that my car had now been off for 3 or 4 hours, and there was really no way it could be the car. I was hearing more knocking and like I had earlier. It sounded like someone was smacking a branch against a tree. I realized whatever creature this was; it must be the same one that came by before because the knocking and the low growl started at the same time after being silent for so long. It sounded like it was in the same area behind my campsite where I had heard the thump earlier. It was now about 7 pm, about 2 hours until dark. Being there by myself made me very nervous, especially with the growling noise and tree knocking apparently being directed toward me and my campsite. I got out of there as fast as I could. I got back to town and felt very paranoid. I spent time walking downtown Walla Walla calming myself down and recounting the events. I had never been so scared of the outdoors. People noticed I looked visibly shaken though I had not mentioned the incident.

We had a cook out  camp fire in the Community Kitchen there. It was on April 9th, 2001, a Monday, which we purposely chose to avoid the crowds. Not that there are many people out there in the Winter but a Monday evening will usually guarantee no others will be around. It was cold out, just above freezing, and it had been raining quite a bit earlier.  We had a nice dinner. We had cooked on our portable BBQ earlier in the evening which had included BBQ steak. We had already picked up and put away all of our gear so we were ready to go when we wanted to. At 11:50 PM we had just looked at our watches thinking it was time to go, when from across the creek, about 200 yards away, came a shrieking yell that both startled and shocked us. The yell came from across the creek, up on a ridge due west of us.   At first I thought it was an emergency siren going off at nearby Bonneville Dam, but the siren quality of yell quickly turned into a very breathy roar of some very large animal. It lasted about 10 seconds. We stared at each other in disbelief. Before either of us could utter a word, another yell, just like the first, came from behind the Community Kitchen no more that 100 feet from us.  This was the first time that I had ever experienced the hair standing up on the back of my neck.  I thought I would have been able to identify any animal that lived in the forests of Oregon but this call was completely new to me. We stood there silent, listening for about 5 minutes. We knew that we were right in the middle of the two calls so maybe these two animals were going to meet right where we were standing.  We then decided to leave. I was so glad. When I was inside my truck we locked the doors right away. We did leave our left-over food behind for them in case they were interested in that. I was skeptical about Bigfoot before but I try to keep an open mind.  The only place I have heard the same exact calls since was in a film that was a 70's Class B movie called The Bermuda Triangle. Another thing to note on that occasion was that the snow line was unusually low still for that time of year. We thought that maybe this had driven these bigfoots down low in search of food.

My 16 year old son (at the time) and I were on a three day hiking trip in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon. We were hiking on trail # 900, to a snow shelter cabin we've been going to for about the last 10-12 years at the time. It is called Greyback shelter off of trail #900 or Obrien Creek Trail. The entire area is wilderness and you can reach the Oregon caves from the same main trail # 1207, also called the Siskiyou/Rogue division trail. On the southwest side of the cabin there is a huge meadow where there used to be another cabin built in the 40's by cattlemen. On the third and final morning we woke up in the shelter where we had camped. And, I had to answer natures call, my son was just getting woke up when I told him I would be back in a few minutes. I walked to the meadow where there is an old outhouse type thing just to the back of the old cabin that stood there, and well... After, I had finished, I remember feeling like I was being watched, and I walked toward the path that connected the two cabins in the meadow. The meadow is beautiful, so it being about 8:00 - 8:30 AM, I stood at the base of the meadow to enjoy the scenery.  Then, above me I heard a screeching howl/guttural like sound, that lasted a couple of seconds and ended abruptly, and began again, it seemed like it went on for about 2-3 minutes. I stood there looking up to the area I heard the sound and could not see anything, which was weird because it is relatively open meadow with rolls and dips. I didn't recognize the animal making the sound. Like so many of your reports that I have read, I'm a hunter, hiker outdoorsy kind of a guy. And, I had a hard time identifying the sound, still can't. But, it kind of freaked me out. I pulled my pistol and quickly, cautiously went to the cabin were my son was, and We never go to mountains without a firearm, He had heard the sound as well, and he had pulled his weapon, he knew it was me coming I was calling him to let him know it was me, as I came around the cabin I saw my son looking in the same direction as I had when we both heard the sound, he was as white as a sheet. We were both very visible shaken. He then asked me \"DAD, what the hell was that?\" I know my son is a teenager, I know he cusses, but not around me at the time. We ate and uneasy breakfast and packed our gear and headed out, a lot earlier than we would normally. All the way down the trail back to my truck we constantly check our back trail, it only being about a mile and half down and out of the area it was probably my longest hike. We have not been back to the cabin since, and that was just over 2 years ago. I would also like to add that the sounds we heard that day are similar to two of your sound clips 1973 Puyallup and the 1978 Snohomish county whoops/ howls. But, with a little more guttural grunt that ended abruptly, it did not taper off like a coyote, fox, wolf or elk; it just stopped and started again. My name is B. H., and I lived in Medford, Oregon.

I was  with my dog at the North jetty, in Ft. Stevens State Park. It was a very stormy day and the surf was high, crashing over the rocks on the jetty and pounding the beach. From the viewing tower I saw a man-like figure walk down off the grassy area onto the beach.  At first I did not think too much of this \"person\" out on the sands. Then I watched as the figure neared the edge of the water. It was waving its arms up and down facing the surf and the tower.  There was another person on the tower with his daughter and they too saw the figure; we looked at each other with a \"what the hell is that\" look but said nothing and continued to watch this figure standing on the beach. At this point I noticed a pick up truck with its lights on approaching up the beach from the south. Then the scale of the figure really struck me; it had to be a good 8 feet tall or more. The figure quickly turned and moved very fast off the beach before the truck was in range. It did not run but rather \"strode\" the 30 or so yards to the dunes edge, then took one or two steps up the embankment and was gone. I was all excited and scared on what I has just seen.  I decided to go to the nearest parking lot near where the figure came down on the beach and see if I could get another look at it. As I approached the beach I became even more afraid, the wind was so strong I could hear nothing but the roar of the surf and the howl of the wind through my coat's hood.  My dog was anxious and stayed close to me. I went to the beach and found where it came down the sand hill, the sand was all torn up from its passage. But when I discovered the hill was an easy 10 foot high, I really became fearful and decided to return to my car and leave instead of following the tracks into the grass.

The occurrences have not been limited to a particular time of year. I have never, nor has any in our group, sighted a creature. Most have experienced hearing knocks, LOUD branch breaks, hearing bi-pedal footsteps emanating from a creature much larger than a human would make, smelled noxious odors, and had that inexplicable feeling of being watched. The place is a cabin which has been in my son-in-law\u2019s family for 4 generations. It is located on the edge of the Allegheny National Forest, off the summit of a mountain. Across the lane from the cabin is a large meadow, belonging to a local doctor. This is sometimes planted in grain crops, other times allowed to remain fallow. There are other cabins scattered along the lane; none within eye-sight of the other. My first trip was in October of 2006. There was no other activity at the other camps. My son-in-law (Eric) and I arrived about 8-8:30 at night in the darkness. Upon exiting the Jeep, I had an immediate feeling of being watched. I have spent a good deal of time in the woods, hunting, fishing, and hiking. I am not easily spooked.  After dinner, cleaning up, and sitting up a bit talking we turned in about midnight. Around 2 A.M. I was awakened by the sound of the old wooden table and chairs being pushed about on the deck. We determined it must be a bear, and went back to sleep. Approximately 2 hours later we heard something rustling about the fire pit. We did NOT cook any food outdoors, we brought in all our empty bottles and such when we came in to discourage bears and other critters. In the morning, we found the table and chairs had been moved about, which a bear or even a large raccoon could have done. However, the fire pit had been scattered about, some of the smoldering logs rolled aside. Another time, we were hunting in the forest behind the cabin. The topography is typical Appalachian mountain; rugged, steep slopes, ravines, small streams and bogs. Here and there are small oil seeps as well. We had just descended into a fairly open area which promised grouse. This was early November, crisp but not cold. We were each carrying shotguns loaded with upland game shells. We were walking approximately 50 yards apart when we stopped, looked at one another and asked \u201cWhat is that smell?\u201d From out of no-where came the most putrid, overpowering smell. It was not the oil-seeps, which have their own sulfur like smell. This was horrid! It was like a skunk on steroids, with a good measure of open septic tank, and some rotten garbage added for good measure.  We continued on our way, the smell dissipated after about 100 feet.  We tried to tell one another it was a dead deer or something; but we both knew better. I worked in a funeral home while in college; and have never experienced anything that nauseating.   We also had an unnerving feeling of being watched the entire time we were there. Upon relating the above to my daughter, Eric\u2019s wife, she stated she has smelled awful odors for no apparent reason as well and felt like she was being watched several times. We have heard howls, far in the distance, and others within a quarter mile  or so of the cabin. There are coyotes in the area, yet these are much longer in duration, and have more range. Some start low, and rise toward nearly a falsetto pitch. Others have been more monotone yet will waver somewhat. Others will start low, and culminate in a scream. This is not a bob-cat, not a coyote, and all members of our party are accounted for. In March of 2014, a group of us went for Spring Opening. There were 5 of us there. As darkness set in, I decided to venture out to the open meadow to observe the Winter constellations. This is about 100 yards from the cabin. The cabin is situated on the downward slope from the summit, which is the meadow. The area behind and on both sides of the cabin is a fairly steep slope. It is heavily grown with second growth trees, brush, and scrub. There are also a lot of blow-down branches which makes walking even in daylight difficult. At night, it is an invitation for a sprained ankle at best. As I was observing the stars and enjoying the silence, I heard footsteps. Not in the trail, not in the meadow, but coming UP the slope to the south of the cabin. My initial thought was a bear. As I listened, it was apparent the foot falls were from a biped. I called out if it was any of our group and received no reply. Then the steps would start again. I called again, louder, and the steps stopped for a moment.  Then, they began again, finally stopping by the edge of the lane. There were no lights showing, the moon was in the final phase of its final quarter, and just a sliver. I started to return to the cabin. I was about 20 yards from where I heard the steps stop along the edge of the lane. As I drew parallel to that area, I heard shuffling of the underbrush, as if whatever it was had turned it\u2019s entire body sideways to watch me pass. When I entered the cabin, everyone was where I had left them. There were no new leafs, mud or debris in the doorway. When I asked if they heard anything, they all said no, as they were watching Planes, Trains and Automobiles on VHS. Finally, this past Spring, a group of us went up for a weekend. While sitting about the rear deck, enjoying a fire and talking, a member of our party was encouraged to do their howl. They did. Then about 30 seconds later, the sound of a very large tree limb snapping came from down the slope behind the cabin. Could it have been a bear stepping on a branch? Perhaps, but that would be very coincidental to step on a limb just after a howl. I KNOW there is something in those mountains. I can\u2019t prove it physically; it one of those things that you know that you know. Please keep this location undisclosed. We would hate to see a bunch of people go hunting for these creatures. They don\u2019t deserve to be pursued and bothered. I have been needing to share this with someone who won't think I am off my rocker.

As it turned out, the fog made the dense forest section of our hike even more interesting and gorgeous. All of the plants and trees were damp and dripping from the condensation, and the clouds were swirling around us at times- absolutely breathtaking! It was very secluded, and simply serene. About half way through our hike, we heard a UAS (Unidentified Animal Sound). The best way I can describe it is to say that it was a short, deep, guttural whooping sound. Whatever it was, was clearly rather too close for our liking. We weren't really frightened, but we were unnerved enough to take safety precautions. I stopped taking pictures, and Travis & I insisted that the kids walk between us in a tight group for the remainder of the hike. The sound came and went, and at one point it became clear that there were at least two of whatever-they-were, because we realized that not all of the sounds were coming from the same direction. They were alternating, as if they were communicating. It all continued for about 40 minutes, sometimes louder and closer, other times quieter, and obviously farther away as we continued to climb the trail.

I hope you don't take my report as bogus because of that. Let me explain my situation to you: I live, and have lived, on the Molalla river for most of my life and never thought twice about walking around at night or anywhere period. About 2 months ago, I was alone in my Grandmas house using the computer, when I decided to go home (my house is only about 50 yards away). As I was stepping outside the most hideous feeling of being alone and fear thumped my heart. I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses. I raced in my house, slammed the door, locked it and sat in the living room to calm down from my strange experience.The oddest feelings flushed through me then, and now. Now, before you dismiss my story as a frightened child running from noises, I'll have to tell you of the strange past our 45 acres of land at the end of the Dickey Prairie road has had: Around three years ago, when we had cattle and cows fenced on our property, I noticed casually how they would always stay together and go near the barns at night. Then one day we discovered two of them killed up in the woods by the drinking creek. The killings weren't average killings either. The cows didn't have a scratch on them, both had broken necks and their eyeballs sucked cleanly out. Since those experiences, I'm now scared to go hiking and travel at night. Yes, average signs of fear, but I have the weird feeling of being an 'Intruder'. Thank you for your time sincerely, Shawn Murray p.s.

I am mainly putting it on here because I have thought about it in depth (that's why the delay in reporting), and the only thing in my memory that has any resemblance at all to what I've heard is the past audio recordings of bigfoot (although what I heard had better audio!).  I still wonder if this was a bigfoot, how or why it would have been near a town, but I have no other explanations. I was in Sandy, Oregon with my family during the weekend of July 21-23, 2000. We were staying at the Sandy Inn, which is just west of the main part of town.  It was hard to sleep the night of the 21st; it was very humid and some thunderstorms did move through about midnight or so.  I was up several times during the night; either to shut the window, open the window, turn on the air conditioning, etc.  I got up once around 3 or so in the morning on the 22nd after the storms passed. I was sticking my head out of our 2nd story window, enjoying some cool air and kind of looking off into the woods toward the north.  There was not a sound anywhere (that I could hear). No cars on the highway, nothing.  Then I heard a very indescribable sound. I thought at first it was tires screeching but as the seconds passed I realized a car would have to be burning rubber for a long ways. Then as I kinda cleared my head, I thought it sounded like a man screaming, or better yet, wailing.  But I've n ever heard a human do a sound like that either. It was not a moan or howling with an \"o\" sound, it was more like \"eye-eeee--ah-eye-eee\". Very high pitched. It won't do me much good to try to interpret the sound in letters.  But the way the pitch of the sound went up and down so fast, I've never heard any animal or human do that, and I've heard quite a lot of animals.  If a a human did what I heard, they'd bust their vocal chords. It went on for about 20 seconds-maybe a little longer, but not sure of that. It did seem to kind of trail off at one point then come back. I know it was long enough for me to get a good listen.  It was not close by, either. The window faced toward the north, so it's possible that's where it came from but I can't be sure of that. It seemed like it was off in the distance somewhere. When it started, it was rather quiet, and ended trailing off in the same manner it started.  Even though I was a bit groggy, it was wierd enough to wake me up and even scare me a bit.  I didn't think too much of it at the time but the next morning I was thinking to myself, \"What was that?\"  I didn't report it or consider that until now because I wasn't sure and after a while I honestly had forgotten about it until something in my mind triggered it again.

After being woken up, I listened for some time before getting up and asking my wife if she had heard what I was hearing. She had been sleeping with our two young sons at the opposite end of the trailer. What we both heard for the subsequent 25 minutes was a deeper voice calling, as if searching for someone. We could not make out what the person was saying, and it seemed odd to both of us that the vocalizations were exact replicas of each other, that is, each call sounded identical to the other. It was almost as if someone was walking around with a tape-recorded selection repeating plays in uneven short intervals. The vocalizations seemed to rapidly circle the RV park along a bordering creek and hedge-row. This movement of the sounds would have required the individual to be constantly running. My wife and I both observed out the windows in the trailer, looking for a flashlight or some other indication of someone searching. The security lighting in the RV park made it difficult to notice forms outside the perimeter. The tone and timbre, and completely unintelligible nature of the vocalization seemed similar to the \"samurai chatter\" recordings on the BFRO website.

We were returning from a wedding in NY. We had been in a an area of mountainous/hilly forest close to road. The country started to open up with some farmland. My wife dozed and I was rather lost in thought. I diverted my sight to about 30 degrees to the right and was startled to see something that got my attention and kept my attention until about 60 degrees to the right. It passed quickly out of view because of the speed of the vehicle and a bank and some foliage obscuring the view. The road is two lane, one way and I could not return to the area without backing a long distance. There was no other traffic in sight at the time. What I saw was a figure, only from about what I would assume was midway from between the elbows and wrist upward. The figure was what I think of as being the wrong color, it was the color of a kraft paper bag except slightly more reddish. ( seemed the wrong color from reports I have read). It was long hair covered and I could not see a face. It was not moving during the approx. 3 seconds that I was able to view it. It was in front of some woods, not dense, standing about 150 feet away on the other side of a strip of narrow, fallow, farm field. It seemed to be facing the highway although I could not see a face. I assumed the field had high growth in it as I only saw the upper portion.It was only the upper body and head with the hair obscuring any sign of a neck.I could not estimate size but it was stocky. Among my reactions, I was imaging something or someone had put up a mannikin. I rethought that, as there did not seem to be habitation nearby and a mannikin would likely have been a full figure to get maximum startle value. I know I saw something that I can accurately describe and draw a rather accurate picture. ( I am a retired industrial designer ) From the briefness of the sighting I can only say what I saw  and think that this sighting would only be of value if there were other sightings in the area. When I saw the figure a strong chill went down my spine that lasted several moments. This sort of thing is not in my normal experience.

I don't know why, but I guess I wanted to keep this experience to myself for a few years and then it just didn't seem to matter as far as reporting it. But now, I realize that all encounters need to be in a data base somewhere. These DO exist and when that day of discovery happens, this database will house many of the answers.  My encounter happened in early June of 2010. I took a friend to the Marienville/Timberline ATV trails northeast of Marienville, Pennsylvania in the Allegheny National Forest, to ride ATV\u2019s for the day. Allegheny National Forest covers approximately 515,000 acres or 800 square miles of protected wilderness in North West Pa. The forest is pretty dense in most spots and has many types of terrain. From my understanding the Allegheny National Forest is one of the least densely populated areas east of the Mississippi River. Surrounding the Forest are more woodlands and farm country. The 2 trail systems we were riding that weekend join together and make an approximate 60-80 mile loop from the northern end down to the bottom, and then back up the other side of the loop. My encounter happened on our return back up, heading North. I remember it rained very hard the night before and through the early morning because my friend, who was new to ATV'ing, didn't bring rain gear. We had to go into town to buy him some cheap rain gear and then headed up to the trail. It rained the first half hour or so of our ride and I remember the sun coming out and it was turning into a really nice day for a ride. For those that ride ATV\u2019s, they know that the rain makes mud, which is much more fun to ride in than dust. A few hours into the ride, having stopped and observed some beaver dams, some very old oil wells, a couple logged out areas where you could see for what seemed like miles and other cool sites that the forest has to offer, I was getting in more of a hurry to get back - it was approaching the end of the day. My buddy was way behind me so I decided to stop on the trail and wait for him. I usually don't separate from atv buddies when riding, but this part of the trail was an abandoned logging trail and pretty easy so I rode ahead awhile and then decided to stop and wait for him. He didn\u2019t ride fast or dangerous; he \"putted\" so I knew he was safe, just slow. If he didn't shown up I would turn around and meet up with him. I wasn\u2019t sitting long. I just took my helmet off. That\u2019s when I noticed rocks kept hitting the front right side of my ATV. They weren\u2019t large rocks, maybe about or just smaller than hand sized. It took a minute or so before it occurred to me that I was stopped and that rocks should not be flying through the air and hitting my atv. I was turning my head towards the right to follow the path of these \"air rocks\" as I called them, when my turn stopped. I noticed this \u201cStump\u201d which turned out to be a dark figure, approximately 70-90 feet away, that appeared to be in a sitting or crouching, or just a low position, then stand up into an upright position. I\u2019ll never forget how it seemed to pop right up like it was on a spring, with very little effort. Initially I looked at its hands because I was interested to see what was in its hand, if anything. It was much taller than a normal human \u2013 best guess at this point would be 7.5 feet or so, and absolutely NOT a bear. It was VERY broad at the shoulders. Almost freakishly broad \u2013 I remember that very well. It was on 2 legs and I could see its right arm hanging down, which was on the left side because it was facing me. I remember wanting to watch its right hand to see if \u201cit\u201d was armed or what it might be doing. That is funny to me now, because for some reason I assumed it was right handed. It moved its right arm to a slightly bent position, stopping with its hand in front of it, at about its waist. Its left arm stayed hanging to its side \u2013 very long arms.  It was all very dark black \u2013 a shiny black \u2013 from head to toe, or as far as I could see to its feet as it was standing in 1-2 foot tall grass or taller. As my eyes made their way up on the creature I could see its head was all black as well. There was no white or lighter color that stood out, like most animals would have on their face. I could not see clear details of the face as it was all black as well but it did not appear to have hair on all of its face. It appeared to be black skin - the same color black as its hair but I could tell it wasn't hair in some spots. I noticed that the eyes were black, or very dark and deep, with a pronounced brow ridge. I could obviously tell it had a face. I just couldn\u2019t see defined detail of the lips or anything as it was all the same color. The lips were closed though and in a straight line across its face, not open mouthed or smile or frown \u2013 just straight lips. The hair was short to medium length and not shaggy. I\u2019d say the hair was an average of 3 to 5 inches long, shorter at the head.  It was almost groomed in appearance but I think it\u2019s from the hair being short and thick. At least that was my impression. Oddly, I did not notice any mud or dirt all over it, which seemed odd because it had rained hard the night before and didn't stop until several hours before this. The trails were muddy. Almost as soon as my eyes were at its head and face and I was trying to \u201czoom in\u201d and get a better look at the face, it began to leave. It didn\u2019t turn and walk away, but rather it stepped straight backwards into the brush and the trees and not take its eyes away from me. It stayed square to me as it was moving backwards. This all happened in the span of no more than 30 seconds, from the time I noticed the rocks hitting my ATV, up until it moved backwards. When I play it over and over in my mind, it seems more like 30 minutes. At this point an overwhelming fear just filled my mind, and I remember feeling like I shouldn\u2019t be in this spot right now. I don\u2019t remember shaking in fear or anything like that, but I felt warm and almost like I was going to puke. So I hit the gas and took off.  I wish now that I wouldn\u2019t have just fled, but the feeling that came over me was not like I\u2019d experienced before. I had my smart phone/camera in my fender bag and it NEVER occurred to me to get it out and start video. I honestly couldn\u2019t move for a short period of time.  I have been surprised by people walking up on me in the woods and have hunted all my life, so animal encounters, even bear from a distance - do not scare or alarm me. I was in the military for 6 years, and actually had the honor to serve as SEAL TEAM 4 and SDV TEAM 2 (the old UDT TEAM 2) support, as part of a special warfare boat crew. During that time, I had many highly anxious experiences as one could imagine. To summarize, I am pretty observant, I don\u2019t have a tendency to over-react and I don\u2019t scare easy. I am very level headed and definitely not crazy. I didn't instantly think \"Bigfoot\" as I wasn\u2019t a REAL believer then. At least I doubted their existence in the Eastern US and if they existed it was only in the Northwest US, Canada or Alaska.  This encounter took my emotions to places they had not been or at least had not been for a long time. It has been going through my head for over 4 years. I didn't tell anybody except my fianc\u00e9e within the first year after the encounter. Now - quite a few people know. The person I was riding with that day just found out in 2014. I never told him about the story before, but because I couldn\u2019t remember if it was springtime/early summer or late summer/Fall when this happened. I asked him what week if he remembered. When he told me it was springtime / early summer, he naturally asked why \u2013 what\u2019s up? I told him what happened. It turns out that he believes in these creatures too. He then realized why I was acting so weird when we finally caught back up with each other, and then on the 2 and a half hour truck ride home. Now I wish I would have told him then. Maybe we could have joined together and gone back to look for signs or whatever we could find. Instead, the overwhelming feeling of \u201cWhat the heck was that\u201d, and \u201cI can\u2019t tell anybody-they won\u2019t believe me anyways\u201d took over, and I kept it to myself.  Nobody has to tell me what I saw or didn't see. I knew what I saw. I saw a large dark figure with hair that could throw rocks (and very accurately), stand up within 100 feet from me, in a large dense forest where there aren't any cabins or people just hanging out.  I still do leave the option open for an extremely large man (larger than anyone I have ever met) in a heavily padded Gillie suit with hair on it standing about 100 foot from the trail just waiting for someone to stop in that exact spot so he could throw rocks at him and take a chance of getting shot (most folks on ATVs will pack a handgun when riding in deep woods. At least that's my experience). Now that\u2019s being sarcastic, but trying to make a truth out of what happened. Of course that option is slim, but it will always be there as I didn't walk up to this thing and shake its hand or hug it, so being 100% sure it was a Sasquatch just isn't possible. I am at 99.999% sure though. I do know that a fear like I\u2019ve not felt in a long time, if ever, took over me for awhile. Something told me to go, to move on, that I shouldn't be here right now. Again - I am a very rational person and this just didn't make sense to me at all. I eventually plan on returning to that general area, on ATV and parking the bike and doing some walking. I just need to look around and feel comfortable with that. Ever since my encounter, I cannot put this down. I\u2019ve been researching since and came across various online groups that discuss encounters. I want to learn as much as I can before returning and looking around and I want to go armed with more knowledge than I have now. UPDATE: I have returned to this trail (5 1/2 years later) and found the area this happened. It was strange being there.  Some of my biggest questions since learning more about these creatures are \u201cWhat was it doing there, close to used ATV trails\u201d and \u201cWhy did it draw my attention to itself?\u201d If it hadn\u2019t thrown rocks I would not have looked and if it hadn\u2019t stood up, I probably wouldn\u2019t have even noticed it. Someone told me that maybe it was travelling and recently crossed that trail. The reason for rock throwing and drawing attention to IT was possibly to draw attention to it on purpose so my attention wouldn\u2019t go to something else nearby less able to protect itself. I interpret that as young ones. That NEVER crossed my mind. Just to realize that one was in the area blew my mind away and made me start thinking differently about what could be out there. Now, there may have been more? I\u2019ll never know that for sure, but it does make sense to that question that\u2019s been bugging me. I now wonder if there were young close to me, maybe they were throwing the rocks being mischievous. It is still hard for me to grasp that anything could throw rocks from approximately 90 feet away and hit the same general area \u2013 very, very accurate. If it wanted to harm me, it would have beaned me in the head and I wouldn\u2019t be writing this encounter.  I've since been researching an area about 25 miles west of this location. I went from not caring or thinking about Sasquatch to a full blown enthusiast. I attend conferences and have actually received an invitation to Beachfoot in Oregon in 2016.  For this years Ohio Bigfoot conference, Sybilla Irwin (a BFRO member and artist) is doing a drawing of what I've described to her, and will be unveiling it at the conference. All of this is exciting, and I cannot wait to see her bring this back to life, and return my emotions back to that 1 minute of my life that changed how I think now. I cannot attach that picture yet as the Ohio Bigfoot conference director has asked not to put it out there until after the conference. But if you would like, I could come back to this and attach the drawing, which will be as close to what I saw as possible. also - for more info on this, The guys from Monster X internet radio contacted me and asked if I would come on their show. They saw my encounter on a group. I agreed and did a 2 hour show with them, discussing this event. Google MONSTER X Dave Groves. I am not looking for any type of notoriety out of this. It's why I haven't put up a report. But they found me and asked, so I agreed. I feel that folks need to know about this and that these creatures DO exist Anybody who knows me will tell you I am a very honest person. It is one of my strong qualities.  I know there are many made up hoax bigfoot stories out there, but I can assure you that this is NOT one of them. I wasn't out looking for a bigfoot that day. I did not ask for this encounter to happen. But it did, and it changed many things about me. I stopped hunting deer and have not hunted since that day. I now cannot put Bigfoot stuff down and even started a bigfoot book collection with some very old and hard to find, autographed bigfoot books. This doesn't happen to a person overnight, unless something occurred to change them. That day certainly did change me.", "location_details": "Directions withheld at the request of the witness.", "county": "Forest County", "state": "Pennsylvania", "season": "Summer", "title": "Report 51283: ATV rider has broad daylight encounter, rocks thrown near Marienville", "latitude": 41.51954, "longitude": -78.87955, "date": "2010-06-05", "number": 51283.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "dprujn3sv7", "temperature_high": 77.54, "temperature_mid": 71.005, "temperature_low": 64.47, "dew_point": 64.39, "humidity": 0.88, "cloud_cover": 0.77, "moon_phase": 0.77, "precip_intensity": 0.001, "precip_probability": 0.64, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1007.28, "summary": "Rain overnight.", "uv_index": 8.0, "visibility": 7.46, "wind_bearing": 231.0, "wind_speed": 4.6, "location": "POINT(-78.87955 41.51954)"}, {"observed": "It was summer in the mid 80's. (Sorry I can't be more specific.) Some friends and I had taken to exploring the woods that surrounded our town. We were constantly in the woods for one reason or another. On this particular morning, I think it was around 0900, only one of my friends was able to accompany me into the woods. We followed our normal trail to the rim of Curry Hollow, which was about 400yds into the woods. We strung some ropes, and went down the incline. It was steep enough that the ropes were necessary. When we got to the floor of the hollow we started walking through a section of woods that we hadn\u2019t checked out yet. Mostly we were just wandering, and seeing what was in the area. At that time of my life I had a started developing an interest in the outdoors and wildlife, so whenever we were in the woods I tried to make sure we were quiet enough not to scare away any animals. We all enjoyed trying to track the different species in the area. In our wanderings we had found raccoon dens, snake and bird nests and even tracked a few deer through the trees and brush so when we saw the animal stand up in front of us we knew instantly that this was something different. We were coming up on a deadfall that had been covered over with vines and surrounded by small saplings since it had fallen. We started to go around the fallen tree (it was approx. 80 to 100 feet long and 2 \u00bd feet wide and the crown caused it to be about three to four feet off the ground) and had made it to the base when we both spotted a humped shape covered with brown hair or fur. The shape was about 10 feet in front of us and was close to a tangle of vines and brush. We both froze and just stared. We had both been told that though they were rare in the area, some people had seen bear in and around these woods. And that\u2019s what we thought it was, and we knew we were to close. Thinking it might be injured since was so still, I decided we should go home and let my father know a local cop know about it. I glanced to my friend and motioned to him that we should go back the way we came. We had just started to turn when the shaped stood up and took off running. When it stood, we saw was that it was at least 2 feet taller than us. At the time we were both around 5\u2019 5\u201d. When it started running was when I got scared, it was on two legs. It cleared a good 20yds through the brush in what seemed like a split second. We instantly took off the other way and didn\u2019t stop until we had made it up the rope and out of the woods. We didn't discuss it at the time. Later that week we talked and told some friends, and few days later we went back to the area with 3 more people. We found the tangle of brush the figure was behind and saw a large clear space, the size of which a small family of deer would have made, but there were no tracks, neither foot-prints or hoof-prints. The ground cover was a thick mat of leaves over the entire area. We noticed nothing else out of the ordinary. At that time I had seen bears in the zoo and on nature programs. And had seen them stand up on two legs. This was not a bear. It moved too fast and did it upright. And it certainly wasn\u2019t a deer, or a big dog or anything else I had ever seen outside of a movie. When the figure stood up it was a good 2 feet taller than us so that would put it around 7'5\". It had it's back to us and I got a good perspective of it's bulk. It was muscled but not fat like a bear. And it had sloping shoulders. That was all I saw. I started running around that time. I've read about a foul smell others have noticed during their encounters, but I noticed nothing like this. It did make a lot of noise as it ran, crashing thru the brush and trees. It ran in the direction of road which splits the hollow in half. The other side of the hollow has less steeply angled sides and would have been much easier to climb. Plus there was more wooded area on that side of the hollow. I have never spoken to anyone about this since that summer.

At one point, I realized that the sounds were coming from a point very close to us, and they seemed to be coming from the same place, so we stood up to see if we could see anything. It was then that we saw the animal. It looked at us, we looked at it, and we all took off running. Before running, I noticed that what I was looking at was about 7 feet tall, relatively the same proportions as a normal human, except for longer arms, and it was covered with shaggy (2-4\" long) grey hair. The face was not clear to me. I have slight astigmatism and I could not make out the features at the distance of about 20-30 yards.

I kept looking back as I ran, and it just seemed to be going in a straight path up the hill towards Sample Road.

We thought that it was a way to keep us from wondering off and finding the illegal plants they may have been growing. The only reason we somewhat believed them was, the grandmother who told us the same thing was a minister at a local church. She is no longer with us. The day i saw what i believe to be a bigfoot was a summer day around 7:45 to 8:30ish. My sister and i was going to visit our friends. She was driving. We travel this route all the time. During the school year the bus travels this route also. The reason i say this is to let you know, im familiar with the area. As we aproached the small brige that crosses a pond that we call a swamp we both noticed it in the middle of the road. At first i thought it was a bear. As she slowed the car and hit the horn; it stood up looked in our direction and took off across the swamp. I have seen many bears, twice too close for comfort. I had one to stand up in front me in my grandmas back yard. I think it was spooked as much as i was. We both ran. It ran away on four legs. So i know what i saw was not a bear. I remember being amazed watching this thing run off.I asked my sister to turn around and go back. She locked the doors and turned around. When we got back there was something in the road that it must have been eating. A rabbit,opossum some type of small animal. Probably road kill. It was dark brown at least 6 to 7 foot tall.

An event that I had kept to myself for at least a year before I even told any of my closest friends about. Like the majority of people who have an experience like this, the fear of being ridiculed and labeled \"nuts\" has kept me quiet. Stumbling upon your website and reading other reports prompted me to give my account. Being from the South I have always been active outdoors; fishing, hunting,camping and spelunking. I was on a solo camping trip on the Cumberland Plateau. It was early morning, very dark and my campfire had long been extinguished and my propane lantern was spent. I was asleep in my 2 man tent when I suddenly awoke to the feeling that someone was approaching me. I had strategically set my tent up so that I could see the end of the 40 yard, steep incline that led to my campsite. Sitting up I saw the silouette of a humanoid figure at the top of the trail.(The closet comparison I can make would be similar to the alien in Predator.) I strained hard to make sure I was relly seeing what my eyes were telling me I was seeing. The figure had apparently stumbled upon me by chance and stopped. As I was looking, I first noticed the height to be 6 1/2 to 7 foot tall, bi-pedal and shoulders that were the widest I had ever seen. It was then that I saw a second figure of equal proportions directly behind the first. At this point, the second figure moved left as if to outflank my tent. That is when the sudden rush for urgency swept over me. I quickly started feeling around for the .44 Magnum and flashlight that I had in the tent with me. What seemed like forever but only took 3-5 seconds, I located both and shined/aimed it in the direction of the trail and it was gone. I stayed in the tent and replayed the events that just happened over and over becoming more and more convinced that what I saw were actually 2 Bigfoot creatures. The size, stealth and intelligence of these creatures was humbling. There are black bear that inhabit the woods also, but being familiar with the species and the fact that the two figures stood bi-pedally still and silent for an extended period of time and the intelligence to outflank me solidifies my belief in this encounter. I eventually went back to sleep with the thought that I was no longer in danger and that I had probably startled them as much as they did me.

Knoxville is the nearest large city and is 65 miles east.  Our little community is surrounded on almost three sides by a state forest and the Catoosa Wildlife Refuge.  We have an over abundance of \"protected\" wildlife of all kinds (including too many deer, in my opinion) that venture, at will, into our community.  Always the bold tomboy, I preferred to get my exercise by hiking the heavily forested back roads and trails near our home instead of playing golf as my husband did.  I never hiked more than 6 miles from home, and always in the early morning.  One morning, I was approximately 4 miles from my home when I came upon an unexpected sunny clearing that seemed to have been an old road or path at one time because it was grassy and void of underbrush or trees.  On my hikes I am normally under a full canopy of very tall trees.  So the sunlight was an unexpected pleasure.  As I rounded a curve and my eyes caught the filtered sunlight from the clearing, I observed a large ape-like creature jump from the woods and pounce at something on the ground.  I abruptly froze.  In a flash, the creature stood back up holding a long snake by the head.  Just as quick as this happened, the creature disappeared back into the cover of the woods alongside the clearing.  I remained still for a moment contemplating whether the animal had seen me and how best to protect myself.  I literally heard my heart beating.  I quickly ruled out tree climbing and decided the only alternative was to turn in the opposite direction and run as fast as my legs would carry me. I ran nearly all the way home.  I was so disturbed by what I had seen, I decided that no one would believe it, so I never told anyone.  That was about 5 or 6 years ago, and my husband has since died. Over the years, I have tried to convince myself that I really didn't see the thing that has so frightened me that morning in the woods.  I tried to convince myself that I had somehow imagined it; however, the vivid memory persists.  To this day, I have never set foot in any woods again, essentially breaking a very longstanding and much revered habit that day.  I am still fearful of seeing that creature again.  I have always been a sober-minded individual, not at all given to making up fantasies or stretching the truth as I know it.  I was completely caught off guard and stunned the other day when an ad spot for your show came across my TV screen. After watching your show, I am now convinced that I actually did see what I thought I saw that day on my last hike. Your show also brought to mind the night a few years ago.  This happened well after my experience in the woods.  My husband and I were sitting on our deck looking up at the stars, so clearly visible up here on a clear night in the dark woods of the Cumberland Plateau.  We were quietly listening for the Whipoorwill who nests every year in the woods across our street.  He calls relentlessly for a mate every night during season.  Piercing through the peace and tranquility we heard the most horrific deep bellowing scream from what seemed like some distance away.  We had both been leaning way back in our lawn chairs admiring the night sky, and almost fell out of our chairs in shock.  I remember my husband abruptly stood up and said we should go inside and he added that he had never seen a mountain lion big enough to scream like that.

I shined the light toward the sound, and saw what I thought was a bear. It was dark in color, but everything was either light or dark because of the red filter. I have hunted in the West several times, and seen many bears. I initially thought that's what this was. But as stated earlier, a predator does not respond (normally) to this light.

Upright, it appeared to be around 5-foot tall with a fairly large stride. I wasn't able to notice any other details because of the light source and because of how quickly it moved off.

We loaded our gear in the back and headed back to base camp as the others left to go back into the woods to do some further research. Interested in getting back to base camp and getting warm, and much needed sleep, I was concentrating on watching for animals in the roadway, as I didn't want us to hit something and be stuck out there in the cold. Mike was driving and there was no conversation until we topped a hill in the road, and I saw something moving in the same direction that we were in the middle of the road. I pointed and asked \"what is that?\". Mike slowed and asked \"what is what?\" and I answered \"that thing in the road just beyond the headlights.\" Mike looked and said \"holy s---!\" and I said \"whatever it is don't hit it.\" What we saw was a large dark upright moving creature walk in the middle of the road. It was about 5 1/2 to 6 feet tall, moving upright, in the same direction that we were traveling. It had noticeable hair and its head seemed domed and no neck, as if its head rested right on its shoulders. It was very very broad at the shoulders and thick (massive). It never turned to look at us, so I don't know what the face looked like. We have no recollection of its hands or lower body, our focus was on how wide it was and how smooth that it moved. It was amazing, just very graceful. No jerky movements, very fluid in its movement. As we neared, it moved to the side of the road in a smooth motion then stepped off into the ditch and into the woods to the right side of the road. Then Mike realizing what we were witnessing, stopped the jeep and grabbed the gun and flashlight and jumped out to look for tracks. I stayed in the jeep not believing what I was seeing with it running. As mike scanned the woods following sounds he was hearing, he motioned for me to cut the engine and waved for me to get out an join him. I did both reluctantly. As I got near Mike he asked for me to look where he was shining his flashlight and to tell him what I saw, to my utter disbelief I saw a large shape of head and shoulders move quickly between two trees and disappear. I must have blinked because it was there one second and gone the next. We scanned the woods and the road for any signs but couldn't see anything, we also listened for movement but it was dead quiet. We then moved back into the jeep and just sat there, amazed at what we had just witnessed. There was no odor and no sound, other that what Mike had heard before I got out of the jeep. In reflection on the event I did have the feeling that we were being watched. Mike was so excited over this he could hardly think, so I grabbed a pad and pen and said to him, \"Here let's write down what we saw.\" He was so shaken that he couldn't even write, so I took over and had him dictate what he saw and added what I saw. Not having any way to communicate with the others in the woods, we didn't know what to do. Not thinking clearly because of the excitement and lack of sleep we drove back to base camp, where we were headed in the 1st place. Upon reaching camp, I just couldn't face another cold night on the ground and begged Mike to take me into town to a nice warm hotel.

It was dark and under the cover of trees where we were parked you could not see your hand in front of your face. We had the windows cracked little and were in the back seat of the car when we heard something out of the ordinary. We had been there before so knew the usual night sounds in the area. A owl lived in the big tree near by and hooted all the time. The hill in front of the car went down to a swamp with a creek in the middle going to the lake. There was crickets, frogs and locust all making there normal sounds that night. But we heard something coming through the leaves in the bottoms, it sounded like it was heading to our car. I have spent a lot of time in the woods hunting, fishing and trapping growing up so I don't get spooked to easy. At first I thought it was a cow, but then we noticed all the night sounds were gone, no frogs, crickets, owl - dead quiet except the foot steps. They were on 2 feet a step and a drag step like it had a hurt foot or something. Then being a kid I thought of all the horror movies I watched and figured it was a guy who jumped the train and was coming to kill us and take our car. As the steps got closer I got really bugged, it was coming up the hill right at the car. Finally after what I thought was an eternity I flew over the front seat and started the car, the only problem was it was a new car she just bought and I never drove it. She was screaming about dieing or something when I threw it in reverse and stomped the gas. I was there before and new the road opened up behind me so as I was going backwards I hit the light switch. This was a big mistake because it turned out to be the cigarette lighter, as soon as we came out of the tree cover we got some moonlight and I found the headlight switch. This all happened really quick, but I looked up and there was this animal leaping over the hill going into the creek, it was really wide at the shoulders and had almost no neck. I thought at first it was a bear but there was not any bears in this area. I saw a big brownish black creature running through the trees. I saw two shoulders and the back of the head go between two trees, later measured to be about 4.5 feet apart. It covered between them easily. I asked my girlfriend did you see that, she said she saw a brown spot in the lights like a bear on two legs. I think the car scared it, so we went to town for help. After we got more people, truck's with lights and some equipment we came back. We left the truck lights shining in the bottoms and looked around for tracks with our flashlights. We started to look for footprints, the ground was dry and covered with leaves but we did find large scrapes going up the hill to where the car was parked, they looked like it was where the animal jumped over the hill. They were very far apart, I had to stretch as far as I could from the one on the bottom to the one at the top. I am 6' 4\" with a 38\" inseam, this was a large stride. This is when the whole woods went quiet again, it was nuts, 5 pretty big guys all standing in a circle like a herd of buffalo back to back, scared I guess, none of us moved a muscle. Flashlights and guns pointed out at the dark we listened to the dead quiet of the woods. Then all of a sudden a tree limb snaps - loud, and then everything gets back to normal. Then one by one the frogs, crickets, owls all started making noise again. Really strange night for sure. The next day my brother and a friend went to walk the creek with buckshot in our shotguns. We walked about a half mile down the creek spread out like small game hunting. We came to the area where the railroad tracks were up on the hill, my brother was at the bottom, I was in the middle, my friend was on the end farthest from the hill. Then we heard a lot of racket and looked over to my brother, he yelled my name in a really scared voice as something was going up over the hill. I remember seeing trees bending back as if being used to help something get up and over the top. When I got to where my brother was he was on one knee and had his gun pointed up at the hill. I said what was it and he said I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT WAS BIG. We found 2 marks on the really steep bank going up to the railroad tracks, I tried to climb it and could not. The marks were in the middle of the hill and at the top, something very strong and powerful went up the hill. It had a big stride also.

Shortly after hearing the rustling I began to smell what seemed like a mixture of a skunk and strong coffee mixed with kind of like a dead fish smell.

As I backed out of the driveway my lights caught the attention of a very big creature about 9 foot tall grayish blonde in color with a 4 to 4 1/2 ft across from shoulder to shoulder, standing in front of an oak tree, it turn towards me from about 40 yards away, and it stood with its arms down at it's side, I asked my son to look and I looked away briefly, when I looked back it was gone.  The following Friday my wife and step daughter, while walking along the shoreline of the lake, discovered a bloody and strange deer kill site (fresh kill), the deer's neck was broken and twisted all he way around, lungs, heart, and liver were gone and the deer's intestinal content was thrown about, the back half of the deer was eaten,the front shoulder was eaten,but not the other shoulder. I called the BFRO and left a message, J.D. from San Antonio came out and took pictures of the scene, I asked him if I should roll the deer over because of the shoulder bone sticking out.  After rolling over I pulled the hide back and there was a sharp edged stone underneath the hide with flesh and blood on the stone--I kept this stone--there was also a 10 feet dragging kill-blood streak across the rocks, then it abruptly stops, and the deer's carcass seems to be thrown about 15 feet from that spot with no blood stains in between the two spots.  Upon further investigating I discovered a 5 foot long stick about 1 1/4 in diameter-rigid, with a sharp end on it, and the end of it had deer hair and flesh on it, like it was used to either stab the deer or just to hold it down, then it broke the deers neck, the kill was made from the waters edge side not the woods side, meaning the thing that killed the deer was hiding in the water...I also discovered tracks some were 19 inches long but were not castable, not enough definition, also found some tracks that were 14 inches long, and some 11 inches long along the shoreline down from the kill site, all of them were not castable it had also been raining that whole week off and on.

From a childhood spent in North Georgia to stints in West Virginia and now (for the past 16 years) in Virginia, I have spent a great bit of time in the woods. I know animals and flora and that is why what occurred back in the fall of '03 has bothered me so much to this day, enough to finally submit this report. My former roommate's father owns the property this incident took place on. I have had access to it since I was 15. It's a small sportsman\u2019s paradise of nearly 200 acres and a 5-acre bass pond. I had hunted it every fall since '94 and had fished there for years before that. I hit the woods, completely scent proof, at about 3:30AM and hiked from the farmhouse appx. 600 yards back to the deer stand I was planning on using that morning. I stopped short about 100 yards to apply a drag rope (doe in rut scent) and then crossed the creek bridge and walked a wide pattern out in front of the stand to put out several scent markers on the game trails. This took perhaps 15 minutes and no game animals were spooked. I then headed back towards the tree stand, tied off my rifle and gear to a safety rope, climbed the stand and pulled up my gear. This would give me a full hour and a half to let the woods settle down and help my presence go unnoticed. What happened next has cost me countless nights of sleep and still gives me chills every time I think about it. Once in the stand I went about the business of sorting out my gear and making sure everything was where I would need it, binoculars, grunt caller, etc. Out of nowhere came the most god awful, blood-curling scream/yell/growl that I had ever heard in my life. The morning calm was completely shattered and it sounded close. I immediately ran the a mental list in my mind as to what it could be, but nothing I had ever heard before could match this in either pitch, depth, or duration. It lasted for at least 5-7 seconds. I was scared. It started so high and just kept expanding in pitch into a howl that ended in a menacing guttural growl. Before the sound was even over I realized/felt extreme danger. The real fear was from the fact that the volume was so loud and it came upon me so suddenly that I knew it was close, too close, within say 25 yards. Following the \"howl\" there was complete silence. I immediately felt to close to the ground, for whatever reason (in a 17ft. tree stand), and carefully stood up so that my feet were not dangling off the seat. I pulled out my mag light and started scanning the area to my front and right that the sound seemed to come from. I tried to listen for further movement while scanning, but realized that my ears were actually ringing from the howl. I remember thinking (from previous survival training) to keep cool and not panic, and figure this out. I quickly chambered a round and checked to make sure the safety was on my rifle, a Winchester model 70 in .300WSM. I then continued scanning between the woods to my front and the pine thicket to my immediate right with my flashlight. I just felt so vulnerable, and remembered thinking that this rifle might not be enough so I fetched my S&W.40 handgun from my backpack and secured it to my belt (now I know that it's unlawful to carry a sidearm during rifle season, but there are black bear on this property and I wasn\u2019t going to leave myself without an option). It took several moments for my hearing to return and when it did I heard distinctive movement back in the pine thicket to my front and right, maybe 20 yards into the trees. Then nothing. That\u2019s when the smell hit me. I'm not sure I noticed it at first because I had been handling deer scents, but I smelled what I can only describe as a \"rotten cabbage/ripe dumpster\". It didn\u2019t last long, and there was no noticeable wind at the time of this incident to carry this scent. I stood there in that tree stand for the next two hours until first light and then got the hell out of there. I'm not the type to scare easily and I was right back out there two days later, but didn\u2019t think to check for tracks or any other evidence. The game was still scarce. I've been back several times since then to fish the pond and nothing out of the ordinary ever occurred during those trips. I totally forgot about this incident for nearly a year. It bothered me so I just didn\u2019t think about it. That changed when I caught a documentary on T.V. concerning bigfoot/Sasquatch. The BFRO was mentioned and I found your website out of curiosity. I was stunned when I read the report (also in Franklin Co.) that you had listed, but was even further stunned when I listened to some of the recording in your database. Several (from '73 and '78 I think) sounded similar to the very beginning of the howl during my incident, but the sound I heard was so close and loud and went so deep at the end that they are tough to compare. Whatever made that noise had one hell of a set of lungs though. I was also surprised about the smell that \"they\" supposedly emit when threatened. I had no idea. That was the icing on the cake that made me think that I might have possibly had an encounter. I've always been someone comfortable in the woods, and for the most part I'm still that person, I'm just a little more aware of what could possibly be out there.", "location_details": "From Roanoke: 220 South to Rocky Mount, then 40 West past Ferrum College", "county": "Franklin County", "state": "Virginia", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 13212: Possible pre-dawn vocalization heard by hunter near Ferrum", "latitude": 36.94165, "longitude": -80.04166, "date": "2003-11-13", "number": 13212.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "dnx44t52wn", "temperature_high": 45.65, "temperature_mid": 38.555, "temperature_low": 31.46, "dew_point": 21.67, "humidity": 0.4, "cloud_cover": 0.24, "moon_phase": 0.64, "precip_intensity": 0.0002, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1014.11, "summary": "Breezy throughout the day and partly cloudy until afternoon.", "uv_index": 3.0, "visibility": 10.0, "wind_bearing": 295.0, "wind_speed": 17.47, "location": "POINT(-80.04166 36.94165)"}, {"observed": "This was so unreal, that I really hesitate to mention it.The spot is on Warbro Rd.East side, n.of ready mix co, across from Martin Marietta quarry.This short road runs N.from Hull St.(US 360),South from Genito Rd.(state rt.604).

Arrived way too early, maybe an hour or more before daylight. I climbed into my tree stand and reversed the batteries in my flashlight to keep it from coming on in my pack, as I usually hunt all day until after dark in the evening. I had settled down and was waiting for shooting light. Quite some time had passed, enough time for everything to grow quite and me to cool off from the hike to my tree stand. Without any warning, directly underneath my stand came the most horrible sound imaginable. It started as a low guttural roar, somewhat as a lion or large cat might make. Then ascended in the scale until it was a horrifying, piercing, scream, that lasted several seconds or at least seemed to. I cannot describe how scary, and unnerving this scream was. Words do not convey it. After gathering my wits I comforted my self that I had a loaded 30/06 and nothing on earth could survive the 15 foot climb up that tree. I sat very still and strained every sense I had for whatever it was to reveal itself. I made no attempt to retrieve my light and reverse the batteries. I really thought I was about to be attacked by something that only the word MONSTER would convey. The night was a totally moonless night, absolutely dark. But the leaves were very, very dry and crunched under foot. I absolutely knew that nothing could move that close to me without revealing it's whereabouts via sound. I sat and waited until daylight and saw nothing. The area was somewhat dense at ground level with laurel, my tree stand was above the growth. I am a life long hunter and have spent thousands of hours in the mountains. Nothing could have moved that closely, under those conditions, without sound, BUT IT NOT ONLY APPROACHED MY TREE STAND, IT ALSO LEFT WITHOUT A SOUND. After daylight I searched for tracks, spoor, hair, in the area. There was nothing. Up until that day I always walked to my tree stands with my rifle unloaded and never loaded it until I was in my stand. Needless to say that has stopped, I would no more walk in those woods with an unloaded gun than I would attempt to fly. I was embarrassed and did not wish to be labeled as someone that told tall tales. But I did tell those that hunted with me in that area. For one reason, genuine concern for their safety. I know what I heard. It was large, it was horrible, it was menacing. The thing I heard was no laughing matter. Words cannot convey the seriousness of what I heard. I also drove to the Peaks of Otter and told a Ranger there and asked if anyone had ever reported strange sounds, as I had heard a monster. He said they have had reports. Then tried to convince me that I had heard an owl. This is insulting. I have hunted all my life and killed most every type animal in Virginia, this was no owl. Even if it was a large bird of some kind, I was so close that I would have heard wing beats, or the rush of air as it flapped to get air borne. I heard nothing but the Roar/scream. I might add that it became a matter of courage to continue hunting in the area, but I did. And in the general area killed a deer and a black bear that year. No one hunting with me heard anything that day. But later on in the season, I think the same week, two people heard the same thing on a ridge above the car after hunting all day and returning to the car after dark. The reason I am supplying the story now is that while recently at the YMCA working out I overheard a conversation about someone encountering what they thought was a \"bigfoot\" in that general area.

At first I thought it was a deer, about same coloring, but as I got closer I noticed it was not a deer at all, it was much taller, about 6 ft., from the hips down. As I got closer it appeared the Mom (I assume that since there was a baby with it) put the baby down and was bending over for rocks?

It was rainy overcast day at approximately 4:50 pm.   We were paying respect to my families graves when all of a sudden we heard a guttural call sound come from about, what I estimate, 100-150 yards away, if that far up the mountain from us. It was low and lasted several seconds. There were 3 distinct calls in the initial call. My girlfriend looked at me and said, \"what was that?\"  I started to answer her with an \"I am not sure\" response when it called out again, 3 distinct calls.  She said, \"is that Bigfoot\".   I said \"I am not sure, I grew up in the woods  and Had never heard anything guttural like that before and I have heard a lot\".  I could see the fear in her eyes.  I looked around and told her, I am not sure what it is but look at all the dogs, they know exactly what it is.  There was a very large dog about 100 yards away over the ridge, that was frozen in place and staring in the direction of the sound.  There were 2 other dogs, one on a chain on the porch of a house and a hunting dog on a chain about 75 yards away from us.  Both of those dogs were frozen in place looking in the direction of the sound.  Not one of the dogs barked.  The hunting dog was the closest to the sound and it was still and quiet. My girlfriend said what do we do now?  Before those words were finished coming out of her mouth, I was trying to make the same sound back at whatever it was but I only did one guttural call instead of 3.  She said oh my God Ernie. It was quiet for 5 -10 seconds after my call and then it responded with another single call like I had just done. I thought I heard something moving. When it responded, a rooster crowed right behind us and then the rooster and chickens with it ran off the hillside behind us.  My girlfriend wanted to leave and go to my grandfathers and that sounded like a good Idea, however; I wanted to see if I could get close enough to see what it was. I convinced her we were safe in the car. So we got on the gravel road that went up to the water tank farther up the mountain, very close to where the sound had come from.  On the way up we  passed the dogs, They were standing still and looking up the mountain. When we got to the water tank I wanted to get out but my girlfriend asked me not to.  I listened to her and frankly happy that I did, since I didn't have anything for protection.  I had the windows down hoping to hear it again.  There was silence and then the dogs started barking at us.   That told me whatever had scared them must have been gone then, so we left.

The witnesses arrived at the logging site on July 20th 2003.  Their job was night watchmen over the logging equipment.  It was their responsibility. They were on duty all night. They were off duty during the daylight hours while the equipment was being used. First Site: The first location is where most of the activity occurred.  From the gate the pond is three miles up the road on what they call the Main Line.  The trailer was parked a mile further down the road beyond the pond.  A large clear cut was on the north side of the trailer site.  A road ran north through the clear cut, bending to the east about in the middle.  A spur road extended north from the bend in the road and ended at the tree line. First encounter \u2013 The pond. Date: August 1st Time: Dusk Moon: New The couple was fishing at the pond in the late afternoon.  They had been fishing for about an hour when suddenly the first creature screamed, then in a few seconds the second creature screamed.  It was just getting dark.  The witnesses could not see what they were, but said that the creatures were only about 40 yards to each side of them.  The first creature was across the pond to the right side, and the second creature was on their side to their left.  The second creature was just beyond where they parked their car. Not knowing what it was that was screaming, they became afraid and decided to leave.  As they were rapidly trying to get to the car, a flock of ducks was flushed from the brush at the end of the pond where the first creature screamed from.  The ducks were very spooked.  The witnesses jumped into their car and began to head towards their trailer when two very frightened ducks rocketed through the timber between the pond and the road and one actually collided with the driver\u2019s side mirror of their car. Second Encounter \u2013 Eyes in the clear cut. Date: August 2nd Time: 12:00-1:00AM Moon: New Location: Up in the clear cut, near the logging equipment, which was parked about halfway between the road and the tree line along the right side of the spur road. Later that night, (after the encounter at the pond) they walked up the road into the clear-cut to check on the equipment.  They took a laser light pen with them.  After checking the equipment to make sure it was locked up, they were looking to see what might be out in the clear cut (like deer, elk, bear, etc.), when they saw three sets of red colored eyes close to the ground, in the open,  just to the left of the spur road.  The eyes moved from the left of the road up, onto the road.  When the witnesses shined the laser light on the creatures, the eyes seemed to bob and weave trying to duck away from the laser light. The creatures stayed close to the ground, with one set almost on the ground, and the other two higher up.  When the laser light hit the creatures, they could see hair about four inches long.  Then one set of eyes rose up to be about six feet above the road. They assumed it stood up.  Then all three creatures turned and walked away, up the spur road to the tree line. At the tree line, they turned left and headed down through the trees. The witnesses said that they could hear branches breaking as they walked. They could also hear vocalizations periodically. It sounded like two people who were very annoyed, and complaining. The screams were short vocalizations, like shouts, and were exactly the same as they heard near the pond. That ended the second encounter. Third Encounter - Whistling, Date: August 2nd Moon: New Time: Late afternoon to dusk Location: Halfway between the pond and their trailer, on the north side of the main-line road. The next day, the witnesses decided to take a walk.  It was late afternoon.  They walked from their trailer back towards the pond and then went up a cat road for a distance. They then turned around because it was getting dark. The boyfriend was getting an uneasy feeling about the situation. As they were walking out, they began to hear a flute like whistle.  When they would stop to listen, the whistle would stop.  When they started to walk again, the whistle would start up again.  What was making the whistling sound followed them all the way back to the main road.  They could not identify what was making the sound. Fourth Encounter \u2013 The little one Date: August  6th Time: 11:30 PM Moon: \u00bd full Location: At the creek which ran down from the clear cut and past the trailer. The female witness went to get water from the creek.  She was up in the clear cut a short distance, at a place on the creek where it was easy to fill up the water jugs.  She was crouching down filling up her water jugs when she looked up and saw two yellowish looking eyes framed by black, shiny skin.  She could see the eyes, nose, cheeks, and forehead.  It was five feet away,but down on the ground, looking up at her.  She said softly, \u201cYou stay right there.\u201d, and backed away.  She went to get her boyfriend.  When they came back a few minutes later the creature was gone. Fifth Encounter \u2013 The big one Date: August  7th Time: Dusk, 10:00 PM Moon: A little more than \u00bd full Location: In the clear cut, at the head of the little stream that flowed out of the clear cut and past the trailer. The next night, just at dusk, they could still see well enough to work on their car, which was having problems.  It was about 10:00 PM. There were big black bees that kept them inside the trailer during the day, so they went back out after the bees went away to work on the car. The female witness walked up the road leading into to clear cut to check on the logging equipment and make sure that the doors were all closed and locked.  Having done that, she was walking back towards the trailer, when she heard this \u201csnorkeling sound\u201d over by the creek.  She walked over to take a look at what might be there and saw this big, fur covered butt about 60-70 feet away. At first she thought it might be a bear or an elk.  It was on its knees, bending forward, drinking from the creek.  Then it stood up as if in slow motion.  She said that it looked like a big stump just growing out of the ground.  Then it stepped over a 3 foot high stump.  She said the creature was 8-9 feet tall, and moved like Andre the Giant stepping into a wrestling ring.  She said the hair was a burnt red color with gray tips.  She then ran in fear down towards the trailer, screaming as she ran. She stated that she didn\u2019t know if it was chasing her or not, but she could hear it screaming also. Her boyfriend, hearing her, walked across the road to see what was going on. He said that the creature was moving away, screaming. He said that it threw a fit up in the trees.  It was yelling and screaming, breaking trees and branches.  The screaming was the same sound as they heard down by the pond. This was the first time they realized what they were encountering. Sixth Encounter \u2013 Tree breaking Date: August 8th Time: Approximately midnight Moon: A little more than half full Location: 40 yards from the trailer. The same night they saw the big one in the clear cut, they went out to get water from the creek, but stayed close to the trailer, within 40 yards.  They wanted to be close enough to run to safety if necessary.  While getting water, they heard a creature walking in the woods close by.  The boyfriend threw some rocks in the direction of the sounds.  The creature reacted to the rock throwing by violently shaking a small tree.  It shook the tree so hard that it fell over.  This scared the witness, so he fired his one shot into the air to scare the creature away, and yelled, \u201cStay away!\u201d  At this, the creature went silent and walked away.  After the shot, the male creature made a call from above and behind them in the clear cut.  By this time, they could identify the two individuals by the sound of their voices.  The male makes a louder, deeper call.  The female voice is higher pitched, not as loud as the male, and has a distinctive short howling sound she makes at the end of her vocalizations. After the 5th and 6th encounters, they started walking in the woods during the day, looking for tracks. They found impressions in the moss which were quite large.  The interesting thing about the impressions is that there would be a deep heel print, then an undisturbed space, then the front of the foot.  The stride was 4 \u00bd feet.  At one muddy bank, the found a track where the sasquatch tried to step up the bank, but it\u2019s foot slipped and made a long five toed slide mark in the mud. They began to find stick structures in the shape of tripods and tee-pees.  There were large ones and very small ones.  The interesting thing is that the structures were made with the tips of the poles inserted into the ground and the root end up in the air.  They found lines of single poles stuck in the ground, tip end down, like trail markers. They found lean-to type structures made against a large tree, and there was what appeared to be a sleeping nest under it.  Inside they found hair, which looks like elk hair, and a full hand print.  The hand print was close to human proportions but dinner-plate large.  They found a log laying on the ground that had sticks arranged leaning on the log at even intervals. The couple constructed their own tee-pee near where they found the stick structures and the sleeping nest.  The idea was to make a structure as a blind, and then hide out in it at night to see what might show up.  They leaned poles up against the side of a big stump and lodged the lower ends into the stump roots.  Then they wove sticks horizontally.  They spent several hours that night inside this blind. After a few hours, with nothing happening, they decided to go back to the trailer.  They said, \u201cI wonder what the sasquatches will think of our structure.\u201d  As they were walking away, they heard one of the sasquatches hoot at them.  They were being watched the whole time.  The next day, they went back to check on their structure, and found it disassembled, and the sticks neatly stacked in three piles. Later, they decided to try to mimic the calls they were hearing.  They used a construction cone as a megaphone, and by making a call while sucking in air, the male witness was able to imitate the calls.  When he called, the creatures would almost always answer. This interaction continued intermittently until the end of August.  The creatures seemed curious about them and hung around at each of the three locations where they camped.  They would hear vocalizations from time to time. They said that it would be what they called the \u201csquawk\u201d call, and sometimes there would be wood-knocks or rock-clacking.  They heard both the male and female. The couple was stationed at the first logging site for about one month before being moved to the next logging site about a mile away. This move happened around the first of September. Second site. The couple stayed at the second site for about three weeks.  During this time, they would hear heavy, raspy, breathing from time to time as one of the creatures walked by their trailer.  There was a lot of human activity at this time.  The sasquatches curious about them, but left them alone. Third site. They stayed at the third site for two weeks. At this site, they explored the woods around the area.  They found stick structures, impressions, and the beds. The end.  The third week of September, they told the logging crew boss about what they had seen and experienced. He was not surprised, but said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody!\u201d.  He said that they were afraid that if it was proven that there really were sasquatches then the woods would be closed to logging. The next day, the witnesses were fired.  They were told that their services were no longer required.  This was supposed to be a six month job. Three days later, while they were in town, the logging company pulled their trailer out of the woods and left it by the highway.", "location_details": "Between the town of Morton and Riffe Lake.", "county": "Lewis County", "state": "Washington", "season": "Summer", "title": "Report 22475: Night watchmen at logging camp near Morton describes multiple incidents", "latitude": 46.52352, "longitude": -122.3045, "date": "2003-08-15", "number": 22475.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "c2308vke4s", "temperature_high": 67.7, "temperature_mid": 60.745000000000005, "temperature_low": 53.79, "dew_point": 51.42, "humidity": 0.65, "cloud_cover": 1.0, "moon_phase": 0.62, "precip_intensity": 0.0003, "precip_probability": 0.31, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1019.88, "summary": "Overcast until evening.", "uv_index": 4.0, "visibility": 10.0, "wind_bearing": 255.0, "wind_speed": 0.87, "location": "POINT(-122.3045 46.52352)"}, {"observed": "At the time of this sighting I was homeless and living in my station wagon. I always took showers at a campground on Harstine Island. At about 11:30pm I was traveling north on the Island and was doing the speed limit and watching out for deer in the road because there are a lot of them on the Island. I was comeing up to the grange hall turn where there is a connecting road that travels south on the eastern side of the Island. There is a hill at the point of the intersection and I slowed down to the recommended speed because there is a hairpin turn just down the other side. As my light's came over the top of the hill I could see into the large pasture next to the road where it turned left. It was a clear fall night and the moon was out so I could see very good. I noticed something standing in the field couldn't remember seeing it before. I thought it was a tree stump at first but there wasn't one there before. Then I thought about the horses that are usually there in the daytime but it just wasn't it. I was slowing down to about 10-15 mph so I could turn left when this thing turned it's head and looked straight at me. I remember quickly slowing the car and almost came to a stop. As I rolled through the corner it turned in the same direction and walked at the same speed I was rolling. It was absolutely HUGE! It wasn't very far from my car maybe 40ft. The field is about 3-4 ft below the road and this thing towered over me so I had to look over the top of the steering wheel to see it. I could smell it and it burned my nose. My window's were up but the heater was on. It took long stride's and was actually moving faster than me and I stopped the car because I thought it was going to come over the barbed wire fence into the road in front of me. It walked down the fence line and I folled at a distance but I could still see it very clearly. At the corner of the fenceline the road turn's sharply to the right and it just stepped over the fence with no trouble at all. I remember feeling scared to death and the hair on my body was standing up. It crossed the road at the corner and disapeared on the other side in the brush. The turnoff to the park is about a 1/4 mile past that and to the left. I raced to the campground and took my shower as quickly as I could. I remember almost being in tears when I came out to get back in my car. I was still pretty shook up and I knew it was not far away from where I was.I usually stayed at the campground on those night's but not that night. The next day I returned to the area of the sighting and I didn't see any horses or tree stump's but I did see where the fence was pushed down. I talked to a friend of mine who lives on the Island and he said there were 3 or 4 of them there.

I am a Mason County resident that has lived here in Shelton for most of my life.My father was a State Fire Warden since the late 1950's up until his retirement in 1978,and my Mother was a floral greens harvester for about 50 years.Consiquently I know this area better than most residents as I also run a business that requires me to be in the woods a lot.I was employed by the USFS from 1970 to 1983 in Fire Management. My first encounter with what I believe to be a Sasquatch was in  October,1984.I was living in Oregon at the time and had came home to visit my folks who resided on the Cloqullam road about 3 miles west of Shelton.One evening as I was sleeping on their couch I heard a screaming noise off in the distance(I am estimating a 1/4 mile)that I can only describe as a cross between a donkey braying,a high pitched scream and a growling noise at the end.What amazed me most was the duration of this howling as it lasted about 15 seconds.About 5 minutes later it howled again, this time much closer to the house and repeats itself twice.I can still recall my parents watchdogs scratching at the door to get in.As the noise got closer I could hear a more distant but unquestionably return answer to the screaming. The thing finally got to within a couple hundred yards of the house and the noise was like an air raid siren.I have never heard any animal as loud as this.It screamed a couple of more times and then it headed back the way it came continuing to scream at intervals until it was a very distant noise and either was out of my range of hearing or had quit.The next morning I asked my parents if they had heard the noise from the previous night.They answered yes and told me that they had been hearing it for years. I did a little checking around the area and found an elderly couple who with a little urging told me of there encounter about a year before that.The couple lived about a mile from my parents place and were in the habit of taking an evening walk up a pipeline which runs betwwen their place and my parents.One evening'as they put it,something tall,large,and hairy walked from the brush across in front of them into the timber on the other side of the pipeline.It walked on two legs,and was not in a hurry but took long strides and crossed the pipeline in about 5 strides.They said it was about 50 yards in front of them and had a very bad odor. Other people in the area attested to hearing the noises.As a prologue to this about 3 weeks later my parent's dog came up missing and I found him on the pipeline.His neck was broken and he was severly torn up.I don't know if this had any thing to do with the noise but I have always wondered. My other encounter was in early fall of 1996.I was out with my dog checking on some leases I had with Simpson Timber Company.After my business was finished I stopped at an area I knew I could find some mushrooms to take home.This is in an area near the Satsop River and betwwen the Cloqullam road and the Matlock-Brady road.It was late afternoon around 5:30 pm and I only had about an hour of light left. My dog and I hiked a short way in from the road and I was down on my hands and knees cutting mushrooms when my dog came over to me and tried to get as close as he could.I was mad at him because he was stepping on the mushrooms.I recall getting a whiff of very putrid smelling air.The smell was overpowering almost like something had died with an overtone of rotting garbage.I stood up to see where the smell was comming from and turned to my right and in doing so saw a large hairy creature standing in a fern patch about 200 feet away.We both made eye contact about the same time and I was so startled for a few seconds I had to rationlize what I was seeing. It stood a good 3 to 4 feet above the ferns and was very dark(although it was late, and this could have made it seem darker in color)It turned its head to look back and then turned its torso and arms and as it did I could see long hair on its arms.It proceeded to walk quickly away.I proceeded to walk out and come home.I didn't tell anyone for a couple of days as I kept going over it in my head to ensure myself that this it what I actually saw and I am positive of the events. I have since then found tracks in the same area which is only about 8 miles as the crow flys from my parents house.", "location_details": "Contact me", "county": "Mason County", "state": "Washington", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 7580: Man shares encounters of an unknown subject", "latitude": 47.2293, "longitude": -123.4898, "date": "2004-11-16", "number": 7580.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "c22htvv6x5", "temperature_high": 49.42, "temperature_mid": 41.435, "temperature_low": 33.45, "dew_point": 43.18, "humidity": 0.95, "cloud_cover": 0.77, "moon_phase": 0.16, "precip_intensity": 0.0035, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1022.03, "summary": "Light rain in the afternoon.", "uv_index": 1.0, "visibility": 5.97, "wind_bearing": 205.0, "wind_speed": 0.96, "location": "POINT(-123.4898 47.2293)"}, {"observed": "My brother and I went up to the Lake Cushman   area to look at a house for sale.

The witness described a daylight encounter with his son while spotting for deer on private land near the Olympic Mountains. He said he and his son took some photos of the approaching figure with a cellphone. Five BFRO Investigators went to the witness's home to interview him and see the photos.  We spoke with the witness for over an hour, then recorded his full account.  Here is the transcript of the interview. The blurry cellphone photos are shown below the interview, in the Investigator Comments section. These images do not have enough clarity to show details of the figure, but they do show its approximate size, girth, posture and color. --------------------------------- BFRO Investigator: What were the events that led up to this incident? Witness: We came down the road and turned around like usual and we go very slow down the end of the road. As we come down this road, probably at about 150 yards, maybe a little more out in the woods I could see something moving. I didn't know what it was and we went past a few trees and I ask the boy \u201cWHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?\u201d He couldn't see it, and I drove ahead about another five feet. Stopped the truck and you could see a form coming. I call it a sasquatch. It kept coming. I said \u201cLook at that!\u201d He said \u201cWhat is that??\u201d \u201cWell I don't know what the hell it is and I don't even have my camera.\u201d Then he said \u201cYou do too have a camera \u2013 you\u2019ve got your cellphone.\u201d So I took the phone out and handed it to him. By the time he got the phone working that was when picture 1 was taken. It was about that time that it was fifty yards from us.  Then the next picture it was probably thirty yards, for picture 2, and then it turned to its left. BFRO Investigator: Was it aware of you at that point? Witness: It didn't act like it cared if we were there or not, other than it did turn. It was getting brushier between us and it and it turned, then went into an opening.  It came into the opening and then at one point it stopped and turned its head, looking right at us. Investigator: Did it turn its head or whole body? Witness: Well, the whole shoulder part - the front portion. It lifted its left shoulder back and twisted and looked at us. Then it just went right back into the angle it was. Investigator: When it looked at you, what was the expression on its face? Could you see any of that? Witness: I don't know.  It just looked at us. You know \u2013 deer-in-the-headlights type of look. Investigator: Did it look surprised? Witness: It looked more like the same as we were, \u201cWhat are you?  What the heck are you doing here?\u201d   I was just looking at the size of it cause it was ... IT WAS HUGE. I kept asking him, \u201cDID YOU GET A PICTURE???\u201d You know, \u201cDid you get a picture???\u201d (Witness's son).. \u201cI GOT A PICTURE THERE!\u201d Then it just turned back and to the angle it was originally going. Then it picked up its stride. It moved a little faster probably half again as fast as it was going. Then he (the witness\u2019s son) got out of the truck, the boy did. Then it paused, like it was going to turn again and look at us but it didn't. It just turned, I don't know if it went around something or what and he got one more picture. Then it came on the road and he couldn't get one more picture before he left. I don't know how long all that took. Investigator: So it cut across a logging road? Witness: The road runs through there. Investigator: And you lost it once it went across? Witness: It stepped right on the road and I don't think it made two steps.  The first step and then it was standing, stopped right there and it looked right at us. It was standing more upright. The next step it went into heavy brush - just a deer trail or a little path. The brush just closed in around it. I pulled forward and there is another little road that goes down along the way it went and we never did see it again. Investigator: You said it crossed the road, how many steps did it take to cross the road? Witness: One, two it was across because it just stepped in the road and stepped off it. It's a narrow road. It's just a regular Ford pickup so it's the width of the pickup, brush rubs both sides of the truck so eight or nine feet. Like when deer will jump, hit the road once when they are running. It had the same stride as a deer would running - you know jumping through the woods. Investigator: Was there a trail on either side of the road? Witness: I didn't notice a trail where it came from as much as I noticed a trail from where it went. You know where it came from was bracken fern and salal brush. It's up there above my waist. Back here where it came, turned originally in the opening - there was water even then, probably it's a low spot kinda where it came through probably a foot deep or two feet deep from the rains. Investigator: So would you estimate about 48 inches tall for the fern and the salal? Witness: About that tall.  Then it goes in stages but your base layer is at least that high. Investigator: So what we are seeing in these pictures is... ? Witness: Oh his butt was above the brush, it's chest height on me. [the witness is 6 feet tall] Investigator: From that picture it appears the figure is down on all fours. Witness: Don't think so, I don't think the hands were on the ground. Investigator: You don\u2019t think it\u2019s walking with its knuckles? Witness: Everything else moved but the arms didn't.   They were just kind of there. Investigator: So you didn't see any big arm movement, like when a gorilla walks quadrupedally? Witness: I didn't see the arms moving at all. Investigator: So it is walking hunched over but not down on all fours? Witness: I didn't notice it being down on all fours. Investigator: Just looking at the angle the torso is in, leaning quite far forward - it would be very difficult to walk in that manner without falling over. Witness: Well I couldn\u2019t do it.. Laugh.. Investigator: Yeah, that is interesting. Witness: I said it's not like he's crawling over logs or windfalls or anything either. He appears to be more hunched over in certain pictures than when he was walking towards us, but he was still hunched over coming towards us. I noticed as he was coming towards us that he walked from side to side. Investigator: He waddled? Witness: Yeah he swayed or something, like every step he would really make a big step,...you know like a little kid being proud or something... but I know, well you just need better pictures, you need to be there.. Investigator: You needed your video camera. Witness: [Laughing] Yeah - I wouldn't have had these if the kid hadn't remembered the camera on the phone. Investigator: So did you try to look for any impressions or footprints? Witness: No actually, I can say no, I didn't.  The road is pretty hard.   It's all black crushed rock and that's hard as rock. There is nothing there where he came out of.  He didn\u2019t leave as much of a trail as I thought he would coming through the bracken ferns and stuff. That's what I thought. It surprised me, because after he came through there I figured you'd see a trail, as even brush pickers and mushroom pickers coming through you can see they're leaving trails. You know breaking them away, and there wasn't one. It was hard to see where he came out on to the road vs where he went in. He went in on a regular old deer trail & where he came out, it was almost undisturbed. That surprised me as a matter of fact. Places I went in there I left more of a trail in the bracken ferns than he did. Investigator: What time of day was this? Witness: It had to be around 10:00, 10:30. Investigator: In the morning? Witness: Yeah Investigator: And it's on the 16th of November (2007). Witness: Yeah a week ago Friday Investigator: There weren't any other cars around? Witness: No, there was nobody else there. Not where we were at.

He came quickly to my side and pressed himself against me, sort of hunching himself into\u00a0an extension of my body. As I listened, I viscerally \"knew\" that what I was hearing was NOT a siren, although it did seem\u00a0very, very similar to a siren sound. \u00a0I remember I was holding my breath -- and my impression was that I didn't start breathing again until the sound had completely stopped -- and I can only hold my breath for about 50 seconds, so that's the amount of time I would guess the sound went on.  The same instinct that told me that I was not listening to a siren also told me that\u00a0I had never heard this sound before.\u00a0 Another -- to me -- validating aspect was that my own response to it was out of character, just as Icy's was. Normally I would have sat there for another hour or so, hoping to hear it again.\u00a0It was so amazing -- and I usually can't get enough of that kind of interesting mysterious stuff. But when the howling ended and I started breathing again, my first impulse was to get inside the house, quietly and fast.  I went online and Googled every kind of indigenous Pacific Northwest animal I could think of: elk, fox, coyote, deer, bear, rabbit, moose, cougar,\u00a0various owls, other birds -- even wolf, which we purportedly do not have in this area -- and couldn't find any WAV file that\u00a0even came close.\u00a0On a chance, I looked up Sasquatch WAV files, and listened to the ones that I could find --\u00a0I think there were five -- and one of them, the \"Ohio\u00a0Howl\", was a dead ringer.\u00a0When I heard it coming through the headphones, chills started running up my back.\u00a0That was the sound I'd heard.", "location_details": "Approximately 300 feet from Highway 119, and approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Foothills Park area.", "county": "Mason County", "state": "Washington", "season": "Summer", "title": "Report 28487: Possible vocalization heard near Lake Cushman and Dow Mountain", "latitude": 47.41995, "longitude": -123.2005, "date": "2011-01-11", "number": 28487.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "c22mu881hr", "temperature_high": 33.99, "temperature_mid": 31.925, "temperature_low": 29.86, "dew_point": 24.42, "humidity": 0.81, "cloud_cover": 0.43, "moon_phase": 0.23, "precip_intensity": 0.0008, "precip_probability": 0.37, "precip_type": "snow", "pressure": 1020.38, "summary": "Foggy starting in the evening.", "uv_index": 1.0, "visibility": 7.96, "wind_bearing": 35.0, "wind_speed": 0.28, "location": "POINT(-123.2005 47.41995)"}, {"observed": "I have a picture of some VERY convincing tracks.

I chose the spot because it was fairly open to the road and there were also a large number of campers dotted throughout the woods and along the river at the time.  It should also be noted that it was foggy. We pulled into the muddy rock pit(we were driving a '69 220 Mercedes) drove in about 50 feet and then noticed something in front of the car.

He stopped at our car then came up the side of the quarry in his truck, shining his search beam on us as he ascended.  After asking what we were doing he left and headed down the side of the quarry in which we had seen the creature earlier.  I noticed about a quarter of the way down he stopped and shone his light into the woods at which time the previously viewed creature was spotted standing at the edge of the woods.

I didnt do anything out of the ordinary for a camping trip except through out 2 or 3 whoops during the day just kinda trying to practice making a sound that sounded some what believable.

We werent sleeping very soundly we were both waking throughout the night.  At about 3am I woke up and noticed the fire was about to go out, I hoped out of the truck turned some logs on the fire, took a leak and crawled back in bed.  No sooner then I got comfortable a very loud whoopish sound that turned into a bird sound at the end, it was all one breath no pause, much to loud to be a bird, and it was within 25 yards of my camp.

I did not see a Big Foot, but I may have seen evidence of one.  This happened over a year ago, about May of 1999.  It was not until a recent conversation with a person who knows a little about Big Foot traces, that it occurred to me that I might have seen the results of a Big Foot. I was working up at Canyon Park, in Bothell, WA, a corporate park that is in a region of rapid transition from country to suburban.  There are walking trails around the corporate park, and some are quite wooded.  I would walk one of these trails out for lunch each day; the trail can easily bee seen from the road and office buildings on one side.  A stream runs on the other side. One afternoon in May 1999, I came across a tree lying directly across the trail.  The diameter of the tree trunk was about 5 inches.  The tree was freshly snapped off and was about 25 feet long (a young tree).  At first I was confused, because it was fresh, not sawed but snapped.  I could not find where the original tree trunk was located.  It took me a couple of minutes to find the trunk.  The tree was snapped off about ten feet up, cleared from the trunk, and laying directly across the trail as to block it.  I was completely dumbfounded as how or who could have climbed up there, snapped it, and done that!  I brought out a friend from work the next day to look at it, and we both were completely perplexed.  It was a calm spring, and there were no winds even close to the strength it would take to snap that tree.  There were no markings on the ground to indicate vehicles or a cherry picker bumping into it; we looked.  Lastly, it did seem to be placed directly on the trail to block it. We pulled the tree over to unblock the trail. I was telling a friend about it not to long ago, it never occurred to me that it could have something to do with Big Foot.  It would have taken Herculean strength to break that tree, and there seems no logic to doing it around an uninhabited corporate park trail.  I never bothered to look for footprints. I bet the tree is still lying there.  At least the ten-foot tree trunk would still be there.  Sorry if this report is so cold; had I known what I was looking at, I might have looked for footprints or even perhaps could have checked for hair samples. What do you think?  Big Foot or just some big animal (Bear) or kids swinging in a tree?  It is a corporate park completely cut off from where kids play, so I doubt that.  Too massive for kids to break as well I think.

She was a senior in high school.  Our house is about 6 miles out of town and in 1987 when the incident occurred, it was very rural, though now it has become quite developed.  The school buses didn't go down the side roads so kids would have to walk to the closest main road.  We live not too far off the bus route.  The neighbor girl drove to school and she would often stop and give my niece a ride as she was walking to the bus stop.  On this particular morning she had just gotten in the neighbor's car when about 50 yards ahead, this creature came out of the swamp area on the right side of the road, paused in a crouching position, started crossing, then dashed very quickly across the road and into the woods.  She said she turned to the neighbor girl and said, \"What the hell was that?\"  To which the girl answered \"I don't know!\"  She says it was about the size of a bear, brown in color, but was definitely not a bear.  It started crossing the road walking like a gorilla (she even wondered if it could have been an orangutan or some kind of ape), then it ran the rest of the way very fast on all fours.  The whole incident happened so fast that she was not able to see much of the hands or feet.  She described it to me as being like an ape, but also sloth-like.  I said unless there had been an escaped primate from a traveling circus, we just don't have them in Washington.  She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms.  She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound.  Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird.  It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau).  There is a ravine in the middle of this area.  To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away.  The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek.  My niece said that she and the neighbor girl didn't say a word all the way to school and when they arrived she said again \"What WAS that?\" They both were dumbfounded.  She said it gave her the creeps and she felt scared.  We have talked about it on and off for years trying to think what it could have been.  A couple of weeks ago we sat down and I made a sketch while she guided me.  Actually she had to modify and finish it because I just could not figure out what she meant about how the head, chest and face looked.  When I saw her alterations I thought no wonder she was scared.

It bonked the stump on the side of the trail and I kept staring at it because I thought at first it was a ghost or mabye somebody behind the stump that I just saw do a ninja move. Then I realized that it was facing away from me towards the swampy brush because the stump I was looking had a muscley buttocks and I could see on the top of the stump what looked like a v shape tuft of hair similar to Howard the Duck.  I was yellin and shoutin at it but it just stood their and kept looking away from me, and I knew that this thing is not going to move unless I go over there and at that point I left the forest by going back where I came from.", "location_details": "Removed at the request of the witness.", "county": "Snohomish County", "state": "Washington", "season": "Spring", "title": "Report 37885: Daylight encounter while hiking on the Tulalip Indian Reservation", "latitude": 48.10255, "longitude": -122.2763, "date": "2010-06-10", "number": 37885.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "c2919sc1et", "temperature_high": 61.73, "temperature_mid": 56.485, "temperature_low": 51.24, "dew_point": 50.08, "humidity": 0.84, "cloud_cover": 0.96, "moon_phase": 0.94, "precip_intensity": 0.0008, "precip_probability": 0.5, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1017.13, "summary": "Overcast throughout the day.", "uv_index": 5.0, "visibility": 9.79, "wind_bearing": 248.0, "wind_speed": 0.47, "location": "POINT(-122.2763 48.10255)"}, {"observed": "I was hiking, with my dog, at Wallace Falls State Park on 4/26/11.

We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly \"yoouuuuuu!!!\". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct \"yooouuuuu!!\". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence.

It was snowing very hard and I was cutting a fresh trail waist deep as I hiked above the timber line toward the top of the mountian. After reaching the summit I decided I better follow my tracks back so I didn't get lost in the storm.

We came upon a trail where all of a sudden the deer trails we had been following, swerved off the main trail and up the hillside. Up ahead was a single set of tracks that appeared to be a bi-pedal animal of some kind and there the smell was something awful. We weren't sure what to make of the tracks at first so we just continued along the trail. I immediately noticed how far apart the tracks were and became very aware of what we COULD have been looking at. I had my husband try to  match his stride to those of the tracks, and he came up  VERY short.

We were driving around our property which is the side of a large heavily wooded hill/mountain. We were trying to find a place to build our cabin. We drove to the top stopping about halfway to look over the edge of what we call the pixie stix. A bunch of trees that had been fallen by previous owners stacked on the side of the hill like pixie stix. We noticed something had been moving logs and stumps around. Probably a bear though we saw one stump out of place for a bear. It had been pulled straight up out of the ground tap root and all still intact. No sign of the rocking motion that a bear does to remove roots. No claw marks. So we looked around for bear tracks and really didn't find much. We went back to the truck and continued to the top of the hill removing trees and branches with the chainsaw to get through. When we got there we removed some more branches and scoped the area for our cabin all the while there was something staying just out of visual contact but walking around behind us on the neighbor lot. We left when we were done. We went back down the hill and started up another road that my husband had built with our dozer a few months earlier, as we started up the road which is not that long, I was startled when I was looking at a tree that I didn't remember was there and it turned and quickly moved out of sight to the left. I yelled at my husband asking him what that was? he said \"what?\" I asked him if he saw it, he said no. The branch about 8-9 ft above the ground was still moving rapidly from where the head, I assume it was the head, hit it (I saw that happen). He stopped next to where it was and we could not see anything. We continued up farther on the road and got out and I was talking to him and he said to hush. He had heard something about a minute or two later just as he literally started  to say \"ok I heard a \"woop\" just once. Again he was talking so I did not hear it. He wasn't believing that I saw something. So we looked around this area for another possible cabin site. After about 20 - 25 minutes we went back down to the bottom of the hill (home). That night we started hearing things. This time hubby heard it too. Later that evening when we went to bed and lights were out there was banging on the side of our cabin and then a short time later things were hitting our cabin. Not rocks really don't have any around so it had to be sticks. My husband is a believer now. He was scared. I'm nervous to go outside when I'm here by myself. The next day I did go out and look for footprints around our cabin and found a huge print behind our cabin but it was an older print. It looked like a huge flat footed huge toed person. I showed my husband and he started looking in the area and found another it looked about the same age. So my husband has been leaving food out for it but we don't know what is taking the food. We think maybe due to the fires here in Washington they are on the move but we also have been hearing strange howl/growl sounds that are very loud for months. Our cat would always be in the same area as the sounds as if it was talking to our cat.

We are very experienced hunters (20+ years for me, 40+ years for dad), with a lot of time in the field. We have harvested many, many deer, elk, and bear.

In the summer of 1972. My cousin and I were spending a weekend fishing on the South Fork of the Nooksack River. The exact location was at the end of the Strand Road off of Highway 9 between Sedro Wooley and the Mt Baker Highway. We were both going into the 8th grade. Our parents dropped us off on a Friday and would pick us up Sunday. Crazy werent they! We set up camp fairly close to the end of the road, about 50 feet from the river. We spent Friday afternoon fishing and came back to our camp and built a fire. Finally we went to bed. We both stuck our pocket knives in the sand next to us in case we needed them at night. I was startled awake in the middle of the night by a sound and as I awoke sleeping in my sleeping bag saw the silhouette of something on the other side of a small fence, and slightly above us. It was about 20 feet away. There was a full moon behind which created a perfect silhouette image. This creature made a series of long hissing type sounds. The best discription is a hissssssssssss. Then it would stop for a bit and do it again. It did this 5-6 times. The silhouette was from about the waist up, it was broad shouldared with no neck. It had a sloping forehead and not noticable ears that I could detect. It rocked slightly from side to side as if it was smelling us or trying to see us laying there a bit better. It could not have gotten right us without going through this fence and under some small branches. It appeared that it was likely crouching down maybe on one knee. I was obviously petrified. It was there for probaly 3-5 minutes. When it left it kind of pivoted its entire body to its right and was gone. I would estimate this to be about 3 in the morning. I heard nothing as it walked away. I layed there for the rest of the night frozen stiff with fright, to the point that my body began cramping up! I did not hear anything as it left, nor smelled anything. I did hear shortly after it left, from the direction of the river and sounding like across the river a series of clicks with what sounded like rocks being hit togethor very rapidly. They were hit togethor 3-5 times very fast. I heard this a few times firt fairly close, then farther off as if going away from us. My cousin did not hear a thing.. sleeping away. We stayed there the following night without incident. although with a big fire going and fishing line tied to each others wrist, should we need to wake each other! In the morning I told my cousin and we looked for tracks, but did not see anything. The field that this thing was on was hard packed and it was very hard and dry, so no indentations.

At the time I lived with my grandmother in Menomonee Falls Wisconsin, I had lived here also throughout my life, this is a suburb of Milwaukee. The thing is, behind us was a swamp and around us it was pretty wooded. Through my life strange things would happen by our house; strange bangings on the side of our house, really bad stench (always dismissed as skunks), items being eaten in my grandmothers garden, and walnuts being all over the place. These things could have happened with other animals. My neighbor had a stange event once. Anyway, my grandmothers house was a 100 year old farm house. It had a porch and a couple of large windows facing it, in the inside of this part of the house was a little front room with a couch, then the main living room was on the inside of the house next to this room. My son and I had slept on the first floor because it was so hot upstairs, (my grandmother didn't want air), well my son woke me up and said something strange was looking at him, he was really frightned, so he slept next to me on the floor. Well I was on this website and I showed my son one of your pictures, and he said that is what he saw. I am really not sure if he had seen anything or not, my son is very honest. What I am trying to find out mainly is there other reports in this area? It would explain some things, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. I have been trying to find information about Bigfoot in Wisconsin, your site has been helpful; it just seems odd to have a sighting in Menomonee Falls. There is a heavy deer population there and in the surrounding area, it is heavly wooded.

I've already seen bears (black bears and a grizzly in YellowStone). Last year in October 2000 I visited Olympic National Park and the  last day of my stay I hiked on a loop trail begining at \"Obstruction Point\". I let my car at the park located at the end of Obstruction Point road which is about 6 miles long and is a not very good track (no tar and some holes). At the beginning of this road near Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center there was a pannel indicated that overnight stays were not permitted. When I arrived at the car-park around 10.30AM, there were no other cars. I hiked to Grand lake and Moose lake that I reached at about 12.30. I stay there about one hour and then I return via the \"Badger Valley trail\". At about 4.45PM I was at the bottom of Obstruction Peak just bellow the car-park and I decided to stop to have a rest before climbing. So I looked around and noticed two \"hikers\" who where walking on the \"Elk Moutain trail\" towards the car-park. I looked at them with my binoculars because I didn't see anyone for the whole day and I was curious. They were at about 500 meters from me in the late afternoon sunshine and I was in the shadow so I think that they couldn't see me. My binoculars are not very good but I immediately noticed that they carried no equipment (no bags, no sticks...)and that they seemed to be very tall. There were no trees on the trail to confirm that impression but they really seemed to me very tall, specially the second one. Then I notice that they were \"dressed\" in a uniform dark colour from the top of their heads to the tip of their hands and legs (I couldn't see their feet because I was below them). I could not see any other colours on them even on their faces or their hands. I thought that they were looking like giants dressed as the police special forces men! I decided to look specially at the second one because I could not see the two of them in the same time in my binoculars. I noticed he had a strange way to walk: His head was down like he was looking at his feet and his arms which seem very long (the hands were at the same level than the knees) were moving amply. It was like he was tired (because of the position of the head) and alert (because of the movment of his arms and legs) in the same time! At one moment the first one who was walking about 10 meters ahead stopped to look at the second one but didn't wait for him and continue to walk. Then I began to think that these two hikers were really strange and I realise that they were walking in the same direction than me so I climb to the car-park as fast I can to check if they had a car there. I was thinking that if there was another car beside mine it would prove to me that everything was OK and that these two \"hikers\" were just like me. But when I arrived at the park there was no other car so in a very short time I thought that: 1- it was almost the end of the day. 2- We were 6 miles from the concrete road. 3- It was forbidden to make an overnightstay in this area. 4- These two strange looking \"hikers\" didn't carry anything on their back to spend a night in the outback. And I thought about the patterson film I saw on a  TV show some years ago so I decided to get out of  there very quickly. I did not see any car or people until I reach the concrete road and the Hurricane ridge visitors center. I know now that the patterson movie is maybe not the hoax I thought it was.

As he runs down through the same meadow, the sasquatch is still walking about there, retreats downhill, crosses a small creek and stops on the far bank of the creek under a fir tree to face his pursuers, his entire body bathed in sunlight and visible from head to toe. Nick stops about 30' away, his mother stands about 15' behind him. This silent tableau holds its place for what seems an extraordinarily long time, perhaps 5 minutes, although Nick's and Brenda's estimates, colored by the adrenaline of the encounter, range as high as 20 minutes. Whatever length of time passes, it gives Nick and Brenda the opportunity for detailed inspection of the sasquatch. They describe it as being 6'6\" tall (as measured against a branchlet that barely touched the crown of its head), covered with black-gray fur and golden brown patches on its shoulders and chest. The hair is 4\"-5\" long and dirty with burrs in it. The head is notable for its pronounced brow ridge and deep set eyes, that are \"less open than human eyes\" [facing into the sun]. It has a wide and stumpy nose, the hairiness under the nose getting thicker, hiding the jaw line. It has impressively wide shoulders (\"Man, they were this wide!\", Nick holds his hands far apart in retelling), heavy arms, wide hands with thick fingers and dark brown and rough palms. Its nails have a deep yellow \"nicotine-stained\" color. Its torso narrows somewhat to the waist, no genitals are visible in the fur, and it has \"sort of a small butt for a man\", according to Brenda's astute assessment. Both observers perceive the animal as a male. Neither of them detects any smell. In due time Brenda gets the \"willies\" and anxiously screams to Nick to break it off. Thereupon the sasquatch screams, takes a step across the creek toward them, while holding its arms out to the side by about 45 degrees, as if to herd them on their way. They run halfway up the hill to the house, when Nick feels compelled to give it one more look. He is rewarded by a repeat of the faintly aggressive display. They continue to the house, Brenda scooping up John from the lawn, who says: \"Mommy, there is a big monkey in our backyard\". Brenda climbs up on the low garage roof and watches the sasquatch walk away. The dogs stay under the house for a safe two hours and will not let themselves be coaxed out, even by having meat waved at them. The horse has substantial abrasions on its fetlocks from having gotten snagged on a rope in its panic. Brenda phones 911, but hangs up before the call is answered. After some time she phones back and reports the encounter, which is duly noted in the police blotter, but not acted upon. Only an alert reporter from the Vancouver Columbian catches the brief note and looks up the family. This reporter and several Sasquatch investigators canvas the surroundings and neighbors and come up with a few additional items. Two sets of foot prints are found, 12\" long and 6\" long, whereupon Brenda puts a roast chicken into a high tree fork, since she wants to see the \"baby\". An adjacent unused meadow has a large depressed area of grass in it. A patch of thimbleberries is found on the steep hillside to have been stripped of its fruit and leaves, leaving bare canes behind. The adjacent farmer's cows, which had just been turned loose for the summer into a higher, lush meadow, come rushing back to the barn that night, something the farmer had never observed before. After about a week, little John comments casually: \"The little monkey isn't coming to play anymore\".", "location_details": "Just South of the small community of Yacolt, Washington.

The logging road we were on takes you out to the Wynoochie lake. A friend of mine and I were driving out to meet some friends who were camping. They were a few miles back off the paved road. We stopped the truck to get out and check the bed to make sure we had everything before we got too deep out in the woods. Like food, beverages etc.. It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck). We both get in the truck about the same time and close the doors, dome light goes off and we notice something standing roughly 15-20' ahead of us, in the middle of a single lane logging road. We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me. What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair. The part of the road we were parked was cut out from a small hill. The banks were roughly 6' high on each side of the road. Before we could take a picture, honk, do anything at all, from a standing position it jumped up and was up and over the bank. The headlights didn't show the exact height but in my guess it had to be at LEAST 7'. I'm over 200lbs and it made me look like a baby. To this day, I still haven't gone down that logging road.

I walked onto my back porch and noticed an unrecogizable sound. Since I'm into nature observation and tracking, and had heard audio recordings of alleged Sasquatch vocalizations, this possibility was in the back of my mind. I walked to the edge of the ravine and listened intently to the patterns of barks and growls. They were more audible than any canine and had an order to them which reminded me of sogbirds, repeating notes over and over. They didn't sound like any coyotes or elks or other fauna. I went into a slight panick at the thought of it being a Sasquatch, which I was sure it was. I ran back to my house as fast as I could and grabbed my tape recorder which I usually use for recording bird songs. I spent the next twenty minutes waving the microphone into the night air. I then went back inside to see if it was working, but found to my dismay that the battery in the microphone was dead! By the time I got it working, the animal had stopped vocalizing. Throughout this twenty minute period, several dogs gradually began barking with greater and more frequent intensity. It was interesting to contrast the difference in the dogs barking to the complex patterns of the alleged Sasquatch noises. The sounds were more structured, they had a greater range of expression and caried further through the forest. The next day, I went out on foot to the spot and found the broken and trampled branches, the ripped tarp, the coyote carcass, the dog food bowl and the unknown animal scat. I surmised this was a form of territorial marking. Perhaps the Bigfoot picked up the items from a backyard or killed the coyote. There didn't appear to be any recent human activity there. There were no regular trails, the terrain was steep, and slippery, the nearest house about 800 feet away.

Sorry for the delay but what I saw doesn't seem explainable other than a sasquatch. I was staying at a place called Mariner Village about 5 miles south of Ocean Shores. It's about 1/4 mile from the north jetty at Browns Pt. The time is about 1:30am (I knew this because I had just left my room at 1:20 am to return to my fire on the beach). My back was to the ocean watching the fire. I turned to look at the ocean (which was about 30 yards away) and saw what I thought was a person walking south along the water line down the beach. The moon was full and when I first saw it, it was directly west of me. What I could see was a dark figure from about mid-torso up because the beach slopes down quite a bit in that area. It appeared to be just a person out for a late night/early morning stroll on the beach. So I decide to follow them, maybe go talk to them and start walking at an angle down the beach to cut them off. Seeing that I wasn't catching up to them I start running down the beach still at an angle in there direction. It was hard to make out detail while running so I stopped to get a better look. That's when I realized the following, with the full moonlight I could see only it's upper body and it was all black, it had no neck, looked like it was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I start running again as fast as I could. This thing was fast, it must have covered the 1/4 mile from where I first saw it down to about 50 yards from the jetty in about a minute and a half. I stop running and I could see it way down the beach about 200 yards away. It stopped about 50 yards from the jetty turned and faced the ocean. It was at an area on the beach that I saw it's feet turn towards the incoming waves. It's movements seemed very unnatural and overexagerated. When it turned towards the ocean it flexed it's back like it was leaning backwards. It seemed like it was looking back to see where I was. I know it saw me standing by the fire, I had a white t-shirt on and a shaved head, and probably saw me go after it, that's why it got down the beach so fast. It moved off and when it got near the shadow of the jetty I lost sight of it. That's when I decided to turn around and go back. Tried to find tracks but it was moving along the water line at high tide, the waves would have covered them up. The next day I took my friend told him to go stand down by the water and stood in the spot I first saw it, I could barely see the top of his head. Like I said I didn't report this for awhile because it's hard to fathom this happening in such a populated area. But considering the surrounding area, Oyhut State Game Refuge is very close and only 6 miles away is thick forested area to the north,one of these creatures could travel that distance easily in the cover of darkness.

He gave me a grin that was CLEARLY a threat, turned back around and vanished into the roadside brush. So I got to see a Sasquatch up close and personal.  My window was down and I was no more than 20 feet from him.  His face was human looking except that he had no chin and he had a somewhat heavy brow ridge.  The nose was a human nose and was more european than african looking.  The eyes were black, the skin was grey as was his hair and he had more or less human teeth...what was left of them.  His teeth were in terrible condition.  When he ran, his palms were down, not thumbs up like us, and when he stood his palms faced back rather than thumbs forward like a person.  The arms looked a bit longer than a human but not more than half a hand length longer.  Also since it was around one in the afternoon and I was looking south at him I could see the shape of his head through the hair in the sun.  The hair sticks way up and makes him look like he has a pointy head but really the shape of the head is human.  My guess and it is only a guess,  is that he was about 7-8 feet tall.

First, I must say that I am not easily taken to believing \"out there\" kinds of stories, but I feel I can explain most things in my environment while other things simply put, defy explanation.  I lived in a 22 ft. travel trailer in the woods just outside of Port Townsend, Washington at the time, which - for this report I will say roughly - was about summer 1998 or so.  It was long after dark and I  was inside writing or something and heard a strange bellowing noise just off through the woods.  It was so different than anything I'd ever heard since I moved there a year or so before that I got up and opened the door and stepped out onto the open porch.  It was a clear and still night and out in the country there it is very dark and very quiet.  I could see the stars so well.  When I heard it the second time I was immediately perplexed by what I was hearing, followed by the kind of sensation where they say \"the hairs on the back of my neck stood up\".  It sounded like a call from a large beast.  I study music technology and am well familiar with timbre, frequency, and volume and I can honestly say that the type of voice mechanism and size of it's vocal chords/chest cavity had to be at least the size of a large buck to an elk or bear.  I am also a long time, studied and experienced singer.  I do very well at imitating voices and I was struck by this bellowing as being from not only a large animal, but also an animal which must be nocturnal AND trying to communicate.  But with what or who?  So, I only heard the two bellows and after waiting a few minutes, I decided to get a flashlight and walk up the dirt road where the noise was coming from.  I didn't find anything, but I did hear other voices through the woods in the vacinity from which the noise came and I recognized them as coming from a nearby yurt, just on the other side of a small lake from me.  It was in comparison of these voices that I determined that the crys I initially heard were coming from a distance of about 100 to 150 yards.  The only other thing I should mention about the instance is that I lived on the edge of a green belt that runs, unbroken, from Port Townsend city limits, all the way into the Olympic National Park.  Furthermore, my good friend, Todd, living on the same green belt was sleeping outside one night and heard a creature of large size come lumbering up, sticks cracking and brush sweeping and all, and get very close to where he was in a tree- loft, then sat quiet for several minutes before crashing off through the brush, the way it had come. Please understand, I have hiked the deep Olympic Mts. avidly for 12 years.  I've even worked out there at times, and I've never heard anything like the bellowing I heard that night.  And at the risk of sounding cliche or hoaky, that voicing sounded more like wookie, without the rattling throat sound that any other known sound.  But it's true also that after years of hiking and tracking in the mountains, I've never seen a bear or cougar, nor their remains and though I know they are out there, I have only but chanced to stumble upon a fresh cougar den along the Lyre River but nary a single cat in sight. Call it what you will, I say had a sasquatch experience and some of my trusted friends can report similar strange occurances.  Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Browns and Blacks, whatever they call them out here, they're real.  And researcher Grover Crantz recently moved 35 minutes down the road from here in Sequim.

A mile or so later you come to a left turn onto Jacob Miller Rd.  You follow that for a few miles, passing the county landfill, and you come to Hastings Rd.  You turn right, and less than a mile later, you turn left on Cook Av.  perhaps half a mile later you round a curve and find Elmira Rd.  On the left.  This is the general vacinity from which the bellowing came from.  The location of the friend's occurance would be the same turn onto Jacob Miller, but then a quick left onto Old Discovery Rd. and taking, I believe, the second right onto Arcadia Rd - then a quick left down this dirt road which I think is unmarked except for red fire markers.

It was the first night of the expedition and my brother and I had been asked (as well as two other team members) to go to a location that had a recent sighting reported by [a local law enforcement officer]. The objective for the night was to walk a portion of the mountain road while making occasional wood knocks with hopes of attracting a sasquatch. By the time we arrived at the location and prepared all of our gear it had become completely dark.  We started walking down the mountain road.  After about 5 minutes of walking we heard two short grunting sounds that came from the woods to our left (south of the road).  The grunting noises were very deep sounding, had some power behind them. There were a few moments of silence and blank stares between us. We continued down the road, wondering if the thing would make more noise. We continued doing wood knocks as we walked. A few hours passed as we continued to walk up and down the 3/4 mile stretch of the road, knocking every 20-30 minutes.  Then we were contacted by radio from another team that was positioned approximately 3-5 miles from us along the banks of [a river]. The river team had apparently been hearing wood knocks coming from somewhere between their location and our location. They wanted to check if it was our wood knocks they were hearing. To see whether the river team could hear our wood knocks, we made some loud knocks and asked if the river team could hear us. The river team asked us to repeat the knocks a few times. After a few tries they said they were not able to hear our knocks at all, so whatever they were hearing was closer to them. We continued back up the road.  Not longer after climbing back up the road we heard what I could only describe as a scream that came from the southwest of us, approximately 250 - 300 yards in the woods. The \"scream\" started as a low, deep moan and went into a very high pitched screech lasting at least a few seconds.  It was very unlike anything we had ever heard. We were shocked because we had hunted in the Pacific Northwest for years and knew every kind of large animal sound. Several minutes of silence went by and we decided to proceed up the road further to where the truck was parked.  After reaching the truck we unloaded some of our equipment. We were ready to start heading back down the road again when we heard the second scream. This time the scream was much closer, within 50 yards of us and on the opposite side of the road from the first scream.  The scream again started as a low moan and reached a very high pitched screech.  The volume and power of the scream was amazing, it made every hair stand on end.  The scream probably lasted a few seconds, but was so loud that I was expecting this animal to come through the trees at any moment. All four stood there in complete shock at what we had just heard.  We eventually gathered ourselves and continued walking up and down the road for a period of time, wondering what was going to happen next. Nothing further happened that evening. My brother and I are experienced outdoorsmen.  We have spent most of our lives in the woods in and around the Pacific Northwest.  We both are very familiar with the calls and sounds of all of the known animal species in the area, especially elk, deer and bear.  The screams we experienced were not any animal that either of us, or any of the others in our team, had ever heard before. If any of us had heard something like this before we sure would not have forgotten it.

I went with my mother and we accompanied a group of people on this two day backpacking trip. When we got to the lake everyone set camp and it was time to start preparing dinner. I went down to the shore of the lake to explore while everyone was at camp. When I got there I was surprised to see tons of barefoot tracks everywhere. But what caught my attention was how these tracks were so unusual, they did not look like some random people were walking around barefoot in the mud. It wasn't exactly the size of them that caught my attention but how deep they were in the mud. Whatever it was must of been at least around 200-300 pounds or more because I'm around 130 pounds and jumped as hard as I possibly could in the mud, and I barely made an indent. Whereas the prints I was looking at were around 4 to 5 inches deep. Also what struck my attention was the raised area of the foot. I looked up Bigfoot footprints online and they described it as the mid-tarsal break. All of the footprints I was looking at by the lake had a mid-tarsal break. I looked up photos of Bigfoot tracks and one of mine looked very similar to the track photographed in the Hoh Rainforest in 2005. All the tracks seemed to come from a family, for some were very small and others were larger. The tracks lead into the water and out from another shore of a shallow part of the lake and I followed them up into the gravel as they disappeared into some boulders and large rocks by the lake. I couldn't understand how people would walk around barefoot in the rock and gravel especially when it was a very cold time of the year.

My wife Nan and I live between Newberg and Wilsonville, OR. On February 24, 2016 we decided to take a couple of days off and drive up to the Olympic Peninsula. We drove up to Olympia, WA and took Hwy 101 route along the Hood Canal to through Port Angeles to Forks, where we stayed the night at the Forks Motel. Early on the morning of February 25th (a Thursday) we drove south on Hwy 101 to Upper Hoh Road and east to the Hoh Rain Forest. It was a beautiful clear and dry day, which was unusual for February on the Peninsula. After an enjoyable walk through the Rain Forest we headed back west on Upper Hoh Road. There was very little traffic in either direction and we pretty much had the road to ourselves. Approximately halfway back to Hwy 101, where the road once again comes close to the Hoh River, we had just cleared a corner and were at the beginning of a straight stretch of road which I estimate to be about 1/4-mile long before there was a left-hand corner. At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road. It appeared to be 7-8' tall and covered in dark hair. We both looked at each other in astonishment with that \"Did you see what I just saw?\" look on our faces. Without making comment of my own I asked Nan to describe what she had just seen, and her description was exactly the same as mine. When we got to that spot where we had seen the creature appear from the woods we stopped and examined the site. The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north. The trees were just as thick on the south side of the road, but we could tell that we were very close to the Hoh River. There was no trail whatsoever coming out of the woods or going into the woods on the south side of the road. Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river. Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a \"Professional Skeptic\". Yes it most certainly could exist, especially here in the Pacific Northwest where there are still enormous tracts of land that are virtually unexplored, but I would prefer to see proof of it myself prior to confirmation. I am now a confirmed believer, as is Nan.

We were standing on the north side of the road looking up in the trees and trying to figure how to get off the road in the dense underbrush to get a shot at the grouse. I got a funny fealing that something was watching us and could smell a strong smell kinda like a wet elk. (That season was open too and that was basically why we were hunting). I turned around and walked to the other side of the road away from Joe and looked in at the swamp. I didn't see anything at first, then I saw something very big move. It looked like the back of a bull elk so I spun around and gave a loud whisper to my partner (ELK)! By the time he walked the half dozen steps or so from where he was, to me the thing had stood up. I know it heard me even though I know I was pretty quiet. It scared the heel out of me when it did this. I knew right there and then it wasn't an elk. As it stood up, it came from a position from squating between it's legs to a full stance. Just then he saw it and remarked to me, \"what the hell is that thing\"? I said you ain't gonna believe this but that is a Bigfoot. He was worried about our safety and said, should we shoot it? Can we kill it? I said I don't think we should, we might get in big trouble with the law and he had been there before. So we watched it for a few minutes. It was very warry of us and kept rocking back and forth nervously. If we made any movements it would duck it's head a few inches and stare at us. He was worried about it attacking us. It made a posturing movement like it meant business so I said let's shoot into the road and see if we can scare it off, so we did and it did. It took off like a bat outta hell in the direction away fro us. He said, ain't nobody in hell gonna believe us, they'll lock us up in the nutt house if we do.

Fifteen years old at the time, I was staying at my uncle's house near Kent, WA. At the rear of the house is a forested area. Around 7 or 8 am on Dec.25, 1986, we were all leaving to visit other relatives and I realized that I had left something inside the house, so went around to the rear entrance and was fumbling at the lock when I heard a tremendous crashing coming towards me through the forest. The oddest thing about the entire incident was my reactions - completely different to what one would expect. Hearing the crashing coming towards me I didn't (as you would expect someone to do) turn around to see what was happening - I felt a tremendous feeling of dread which certainly didn't help my efforts at unlocking the door. Whatever it was that was coming through the forest was making a LOT of noise and sounded BIG. The noise came closer until it was just approximately 30 metres behind me just inside the woodline and to my left, at which point I very slowly turned around (again it is impossible to convey just how frightened I felt) and I saw a creature standing upright and looking at me. It was tall and bulky but definitely not a  bear standing upright because it didn't have the sloping shoulders of a bear but rather looked like a tall, bulky person in a cheap ape suit. I was genuinely paralyzed with fear and could neither make movement nor sound. The hair or fur was dark brown/black/reddish tints but mostly dark from what I could see. It was, as I mentioned, standing just inside the treeline, so the lower legs were hidden from view - only from about midthigh upwards was visible and definitely looked humanlike but with a pointier head than a normal human. I had the feeling that the exchange of looks lasted quite long but probably only lasted a few seconds before I was finally able to move, at which point I raced back round the front of the house and jumped into the car with the rest of the family, who remarked that I looked like I had seen a ghost. I never told anyone about what I had seen because growing up in the Pacific Northwest, one learns to laugh at the nutcases who claim to have seen bigfoot, and I certainly participated in the ridicule until that day. I only ever went to my uncle's house one other time after that day and sometimes now wish I had been brave enough to have looked in the forest for footprints later but it was simply impossible to have done at the time.", "location_details": "Hilltop Avenue, dead ending side street going north from E.

My task was to deliver the dozer to a logging site.  It was early morning and I'd driven east out of North Bend, WA along the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River on SE Middle Fork Road which turns into NFD 5060 Road east of Mt. Si.  I then took a logging road on my way to the drop off site. As I drove down the logging road, up ahead along the side of the road I saw two tall people walking in the direction I was heading.  My first reaction was that they were really tall and must be basketball players.  As I got closer, it looked like they were wearing dark colored full body wetsuits with hoods.  I tried to make sense of what I was seeing and thought maybe they were bow hunters wearing a special suit.  As I drove closer I could see that they both had unusually long arms and that one had a more female shape and stood about 7 feet tall compared to the other which had a male shape and stood about 8 feet tall. The subjects then reacted to my approach by stopping and turning around toward me and stood in the middle of the road in a slightly crouched position.  They seemed agitated and with their feet stationary they turned and looked at both sides of the road by rotated their upper bodies at the waste back and forth, back and forth while swinging their arms at their sides.  When they did this, they looked very ape like. As I closed to about 35-40 yards away, the female jumped and ran off the left side of the road toward the river and disappeared into the brush.  The male stayed in the road a little longer shuffling to the left side of the road.  Finally, as I got even closer, in one step from the edge of the road he jumped a distance of around 20 feet and easily cleared what I now could see was a thicket of thorny blackberry vines at least 8 feet tall, and he was gone. They were both dark brown in color from head to toe.  Their faces were dark brown also.  I didn't really notice if they had fur or hair.  Perhaps the fur or hair was wet and matted down from the rain.  I didn't notice any odor or sounds. I continued to the drop off site 1-2 miles further down the road and began to unload the dozer.  Another driver who was less than a minute or so behind me on the same road arrived.  After unloading and somewhat composing myself, I asked the other driver if he'd seen anything strange along the logging road on his way in.  He said he had not.  I then left the drop off site and stopped at the encounter location.  I looked around but did not find any large tracks in the thin layer of snow along the side of the road.  There was no snow on the dirt/gravel logging road itself.  I didn't want to battle the blackberry vines to follow the creatures' escape route into the forest, so I took off. The only explanation I have for what I saw is that the creatures must have been sasquatches.  Because no human could be that big and jump like that and I know they weren't bears.

It is a fairly exhaustive hike with substantial elevation gain and mileage from the trailhead. I took my brothers black lab for companionship and we found a spot at the lake near the trail. As I was setting up camp that evening I met a young couple that stopped briefly to ask for camp site reccomendations..As I recall we were the only people up there that evening. As night progressed it got dark and fairly cold..I had a camp fire going and could see the other site a few hundred yards down the lakeside. At approximately 10:00 PM that evening I saw my lab sniff the air and get extremely irritated as if another dog were in the area. Within seconds the dog was up and pacing the campsite and acting very nervous (hairs were stanging on his back). At that same time I heard a very loud scream that was high pitched but also changed octives to a low gutteral roar at the end. This sound continued for at least a couple of minutes and then nothing was heard after. I realize that a lake can carry sound fairly well but this noise sounded as if it were literally just outside my camp. The following morning I got up and stirred the fire. Around 6:00 AM the same couple that I met that previous night came up to me to ask if I had heard the sound. I admitted that I heard something I couldnt describe other than a loud scream-roar. The people then described to me that they heard it right outside their campsite. As they described their experience they mentioned that the creature was passing near their site and making the sound.They could actually hear tree branches snapping outside their camp. The couple indicated to me that the 'animal' was pacing around their camp for a few minutes while it was wailing and roaring. These people were most certainly scared by something that evening..as was I.Apparently they had'nt slept the entire night and it looked like it to me. They appeared emotionally and physically exhausted to me. They never gave their name but they made the effort to come to me and inform that they were leaving immediately and I would be 'solo' up on the lake.

I have sampled the audio recordings you have on your site but they dont compare to what I heard. The screams are very similar but there was most certainly a change of octive as I described to a low roar.

It sounded like a cross between a person moaning, a dog howling, and a cat growling (the timbre was human-like and in human vocal range, it was a high-to-low pitch sound like a howl, and there was a hint of growliness underneath that sounded like an angry cat, but much larger).  It sounded almost like someone moaning \"booooooo\".  The \"b\" sound was faint, but definitely present.  Each vocalization was about 5-6 seconds in length, with about 5 seconds between each.  It didn't seem very loud, but it also was not faint. I listened for several seconds, then got out of bed to peek out the window.  My front yard is well-lit by a streetlight, but I didn't see anything.  I have very bad eyesight, though, so after looking and listening for a minute and seeing nothing obvious, I went to get my glasses.  I noticed my cat was staring at the window very intently, not moving.  Normally when he hears a noise outside he will ignore it, glance over casually, or watch intently with his tail switching.  He didn't move a muscle. I looked out the window, through the blinds, with my glasses on but still saw nothing.  Being very familiar with the noises of dogs, cats, and coyotes (howling, fighting, mating, growling, etc.), I was spooked when I could not place the sound.  The next day I also looked up sounds for different types of owls, bears, and large cats--no matches. I went to my parents' bedroom to wake up my mom.  My bedroom is at the front of the house, and theirs is at the back (both on the 2nd floor).  I was shocked to hear the noise just as clearly from their room, echoing around the neighborhood.  From my room it just didn't seem that loud.  This makes me wonder if whatever was making the noise was really at the front of the house, or if it was elsewhere in the neighborhood and the sound carried. By the time I awakened my mom I had been hearing the sound for about 4-5 minutes, at fairly regular intervals of no more than 10 seconds.  When she got up I told her to listen to the noise and asked her to come to my room (since I still thought the creature might be visible from my window).  She went to the window and quickly pulled up the blinds and opened the window (which made quite a bit of racket).  We saw nothing, and the noise immediately stopped.  I never heard it again that night, or any night after. It was somewhat simliar to the Mississippi recording.  If my neighborhood were in a more sparsely populated area, I would probably be much more certain of the possibility that it was a sasquatch.", "location_details": "Neighborhood is near Marymoor Park (640 acre county park), which is linked by sparsely populated, wooded areas to the Cascade foothills about 10 miles away.", "county": "King County", "state": "Washington", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 17847: Possible late night vocalizations heard outside Redmond", "latitude": 47.6597, "longitude": -122.105, "date": "2005-10-12", "number": 17847.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "c23pjkjvgk", "temperature_high": 57.53, "temperature_mid": 54.685, "temperature_low": 51.84, "dew_point": 47.54, "humidity": 0.79, "cloud_cover": 0.74, "moon_phase": 0.33, "precip_intensity": 0.0019, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1019.24, "summary": "Mostly cloudy throughout the day.", "uv_index": 2.0, "visibility": 10.0, "wind_bearing": 160.0, "wind_speed": 2.08, "location": "POINT(-122.105 47.6597)"}, {"observed": "I was walking my dogs in Marymoor Park, near Redmond, WA.  It was in the early-to mid-afternoon. The park was predominantly empty and quiet, and despite recent rain, the paths were not overly muddy.  It was a sort of hazy day, with some sun, probably 50-60 degrees. We had followed a somewhat under-utilized trail/road that parallels Hwy 520, going from the velodrome down to the Sammamish River.  It is a grassy area with occasional brush.  The trail makes a T-junction at the Sammamish River bank.  One can turn right and go under Hwy 520 to Redmond Town Center shopping district, or turn left and remain in Marymoor Park. Just at the bank of the Sammamish River, there is a stand of brambles that create large mounds on both sides of the trail on the Marymoor side of Hwy 520.  This little bramble forest is probably about 30 yards long.   The Sammamish River travels along the west edge of the park, emptying into Lake Sammamish about 1/4 mile away (or slightly more?), in the park.  (Salmon run this river in October/November.) We turned left and were walking through the brambles, parallel to the Sammamish River, heading into the park and away from Hwy 520. Just as we were at the end of the bramble mounds, and emerging into a clearing area, to my right, from the river bank, there arose a hair-raising screeching howly yowling sound, like something terrified and screaming. It did not sound human and was quite long-winded/sustained. I stopped and stood very still.  I was chilled to the bone by the sound, the hair standing up on my body.  One dog looked towards the river, his fur also standing on end and the other cowered a bit, her tail down. The sound was coming from within about 50 yards of us, but I could not see anything or anyone along the river bank.  There is brush and trees there, so they were blocking my view of some areas of the river bank. The W. Sammamish Parkway is across the river and parallel to the river and the trail I was on.  The cars travelling along that road create a certain roar as do the ones on Hwy 520.  Whatever this yowling sound was, it was super audible above the sound of traffic on both these busy roads. After a minute, we began walking again, and the sound arose again.  This time, it was further away, maybe 75 yards up the river.  This time, the yowling sound was followed by knocking sounds of wood on wood.  At this point, I did go to the edge of the river and look up the river bank to see if I could catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was making the noise, but I could not see anyone or anything there.  I wondered if it was people goofing around, but I did not see anyone or hear people sounds. A few minutes later, I heard knocking, again, but no yowling.  It was probably from the area just below an old non-functioning windmill that stands on the banks of the Sammamish River, near the west entrance & bridge into the park. When we reached the main bridge that comes into the park from the Sammamish Parkway (close to the windmill), we turned east, towards the Clise Mansion and park facilities area, and were no longer walking along the river.  I did not hear any other yowling sounds after that.  Also, from that vantage point (the bridge), I could not see anyone or anything along the river. About 15 minutes later, when I drove out of the park, I again stopped near the bridge to look up and down the river, but saw nothing and no one.", "location_details": "Marymoor Park is a fairly large park that used to be a farm.

I kept blamming my boss that he had crapped in his pants and he kept accusing me of doing the same he said theres only two of us out here and I know I didnt do it. well anyway we were taking a break from hacking through the brush with our machete and we were leaning against this 200 plus old growth blowdown fir tree. I took a cigarette out and lit up, and then there was this branch or twigs breaking like something large walking through the underbrush about a 120ft away. I could not find any rocks to throw in that direction but found a u shaped piece of wood that I throw near the spot where we heard the sounds. ( take note of piece of u shaped wood because in another encounter a few years later and only a couple of months ago I had that same piece thrown at me) it got quite like I said it was cloudy and kinda dark under the tree canopy. the noise came from the other side of this large salmonberry bushes then all of a sudden the clouds broke open and aloud some daylight through behind the bushes about 10ft so that the four creatures that were watching us you could see their shadow. I told my boss mike to take a look in that direction but because of his bad eye sight he could not see that well. there were two realy big adult males one skinny tall female with shoulder lenght hair and she had a bad hump on her back her breast were like a realy old women and she kept ringing her hands together as she was speaking to the other males. there was a child to her left that stood about 6ft tall but was dwarft by the three larger adult creatures. the two males stood still motionless they watched me and did not talk much to the female that was doing most of the talking in her own dialect the males seamed to motion to her to keep quite then the clouds had covered up the rays of light and it got dark again. my boss mike kinda had seen the shadows but tried to convince me it was his boss ken and some secretarys that he brought out into the woods that sometimes he does. right after that they kept following us and my boss mike got spooked and said lets get out of here and come back next week to finnish our survey.

My house was located at the top of center street in the middle of the suquamish tree farm. My family and I during those years of residency had seen and heard quite a few times what we believed to be sasquatch. The first time I saw one was in early 1995, and I was 8 years old at the time. It was a fairly chilly overcast winter day. We had few neighbors at the time and there was noone outside, so it was very peaceful. My mom had instructed me to pick up some cans from the backyard alone. The backyard was connected to the woods. I was at the edge of the woods and started heading back towards the house when I heard something very large running in the woods about 20 feet away. I quickly turned around to look and I saw what I thought was a bear at first, but it was running on two feet and it stopped quickly as it saw that I turned around. When it stopped, it stood straight up (on two feet like a man), and held its arms and hands close to its side. Ferns were covering parts of its legs. It was about 10 feet from any trees. I got the impression that it was hoping that I didn't see it. As it stood still there, I stared at it for several seconds trying to figure out what it was. It was about 6'5\". It was very muscular, and very hairy except for I did not see hair on the face and on the fingers. Its fur was a dark brown color. To be honest I cannot remember exactly what the skin color was, but I think it was light tan. Its eyes were directed toward me. The facial features were very similar to human features. I remember them being a lot more human than ape-like. Its face was not course and scary! I stared at it for about 10-15 seconds until I finally figured out what it was, and then I bolted back to the house as fast as I could. There was a few more occasions that I have seen a Sasquatch, as well as my mother and my brother. We not only had sightings but almost every night we heard branches being broken in the woods and being hit in patterns, hollars and/or \"woo woo\" vocalizations coming from deep in the woods or close to the edge of the woods near our house. We often heard the \"woo woo\" sound between 2 or 3 sasquatches (I believe). My brother and I had gone out in the woods a lot trying to recreate the \"woo woo\" vocalizations and we would hit sticks on trees in patterns. I can only remember two ocasions that we actually got a response. The first time was when we were in the woods at the edge of our property, and we were beating a stick on a tree in a pattern of 4 strikes each. After doing this for about 20 minutes not very far away from us we heard a very large tree branch being broken off of a tree following by 4 loud strikes on a tree. It responded in with 4 strikes a few times and then it stopped. The other time was when my brother and I were in the yard at about 9 o'clock at night, and it was very dark. Jokingly to my brother I did the \"woo woo\" vocalization, not expecting a response, but about 3 seconds later near the edge of the woods that were infront of our house we heard a  loud and somewhat dragged on \"woo\" .", "location_details": "Center Street is the only road that runs along through all of Suquamish.

We were walking down the road it was a little soft from the night before rain and dense low fog.W e were loking for sign when we encountered the tracks right on top of where are tires had just rolled something had followed our vehicle.At first we thought it was a big bear immediately we were on alert.As we examined the tracks more closely we determined that bears dont walk on their hind feet for this long of a period of time.There was no front paw tracks!We continued on our drive encircleing the area.On our way thru the thick buckbrush heading west back to the truck we started hearing noises,something was now tracking us.We could smell a strong oder that was like cat urine or a dirty cat box.At this point we were both scared we could hear it smell it but we could not see it.The visibility in this brush was near 5ft.in most places besides the trail we were on where you could see 20ft to the front or rear of you.We started to move faster for the truck as we sped up so did it.The brush behind us was cracking so we took cover behind 2 trees each of us on the oposite side of each other aiming to where the noise was.At this time whatever it was squealed in a high pitch(almost like a woman giving birth)and took off running n.w. of our position.Hoping it was gone and fearing it was heading for mom we scrambled that way.When we got to the truck she was in it with the doors locked.She told us it was N. of her position making lots of noise(thrashing).We went to investigate,we found more tracks and trees about 4inches in diameter were uprooted and thrown down the gullyside,there was no sign of it.We met up with my uncle and cousin and showed them the tracks they could not beleive it.We went back to our uncles camp for lunch when we got there we noticed more tracks it had come into the camp.My cousin is a big guy his shoe size is a 15,these tracks had more than 3-4 inches on him whatever this thing was it is BIG!!

I use the term walking because it did not sound like a deer or elk running from us. We wondered what it was and decided to continue on. We got to our area about thirty minutes later and set up our decoys and got in our ground blind. I started to make turkey calls and had heard a few reply. We sat there still calling when we heard this scream. It sounded like a police siren but only the first note. It lasted for maybe a second and sounded like it came from right behind us. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and looked to my right to notice a dark in color large animal moving away from us in a rather fast pace. It was big enough to move the small trees that were in its way. We immediately packed up our decoys and left the area. I was very confused by what had just happened and did not want to tell people about it. I felt that I would just get made fun of about it.

On the way back I drove slower than normal because I didn't want to hit a deer with my car I had bought the previous month. I was a little more than two miles from the BZ corner junction when I saw a set of eyes reflecting on the opposite side of the road. I slowed down thinking it was a deer, however as I continued to approach I saw that they were sitting up pretty high. The road dips down on that side just as on mine, there are steep banks here and there. When it began to cross I was a little less than 10 yards from it but through the majority of the encounter I inched towards it to approximately 5/6 yards at the closest. When it came in to the shoulder of my headlights I noticed that the legs weren't thin like a deer or elk they were thick. I thought it might be a bear, however as it continued to cross I could tell it was way too big to be a bear sitting at roughly 7/8 foot high. I also knew it wasn't a bear because bears are meant to be on all fours it wouldn't have \"arms\" that came down about half way down the thigh (I could tell they came down that far because they swing slightly as it walked). When it crossed over the centerline for a moment it made about a quarter turn with its torso and looked at me briefly before turning back (all as it was walking, it didn't stop at any time while on the road). I don't recall much of the face but what I do clearly remember was noticing the shape of the head was not at all like a bear, more like a tall bump off of massive shoulders and that there was no snout (that part I noticed as it finished looking away from me). It continued to walk forward in to a ditch along the road with a steep bank (as it did so walking a little bit towards my car as if trying to step out of the light). It awkwardly turned away and I started driving forward slowly. I ended up crossing halfway into the other lane but I would estimate its distance to the side of my car as I began to pass would have been 3/4 feet at the closest. Once I was pretty sure I had passed it I sped up. I never looked in the rear view mirror, I was honestly too afraid too. The hairs were standing on the back of my neck the rest of the drive.

After harvesting a whitetail deer earlier in the evening near my cabin, my father and I decided to transport the deer to a friends cabin about 6 miles northwest of our cabin to field dress the animal. We did this as we did not want the entrails to be left near our cabin for our dog or any other wildlife to pick through. We arrived at the cabin about an hour after nightfall and I began to clean the deer. I was standing in a small ditch that runs off the back of the gravel driveway. Behind me is a dense pocket of evergreens and between myself and the cabin which is about 40 yards away was my father holding a flashlight and the truck also with its headlights in my direction. To my right was a small storage shed. Past my father is the driveway leading to the cabin and lining the outside of the driveway was a stance of evergreens which block my view of a small field with underbrush and small pockets of bushes. On the other side of the cabin is more open forest which is privately owned and surrounded by national paper land. As I began cleaning the deer I heard a loud whoop come from just the other side of the cabin. The whoop was loud and became louder as it ended. Following that were three shorted whoops that were fairly similar to one another, but much sorter than the first. It did not last more than about 7 seconds and was calm again. What was so frightening about the sound was the purity and intensity of the sound, it felt as though it engulfed your entire body. The sound frightened us so badly that my father and I both quickly returned to the truck, bloody knife and all and shined the flashlight in the general direction, it scared us enough that when I asked my father to drive up to the cabin to have a look he refused. After about 15 minutes in the truck I quickly finished the cleaning and we headed out of there, both pretty shaken up over what we had heard. Now, I have been hunting in the north woods since I was 12 years old and I have heard some pretty odd sounds in my time, but this one was unlike anything I have ever heard. I have listened to coyotes and heard their strange screams and cries and have listened to many owls both up north and at my home, but I can honestly say they were nothing alike. I decided to post this after listening to the two first recorded sounds you have on the website and find them to be pretty close to the sound I heard, yet a bit different.

I heard a series of loud knocks from the woods, I looked at my friends and they heard it too.  It was suggested that it was probably just other people out walking. So I shrugged it off. We started back towards our car because it was starting to get dark and I heard a loud scream. It was nothing I had heard before, too clear to be human.. and too loud for coyote. It did give me the creeps, my friends acted as if it was nothing and we kept walking. A few minutes later I heard a loud scream again only this time it was closer. At that point I picked up my son looked behind me and all I could see was tall grass. Nothing there, my friends made a joke about it being a bigfoot and we worked our way back to the car. I have never heard a yell like that before and could not point it to any animal that I know of.  For the record it sounded nothing like the screams on \u201cFinding Bigfoot\u201d It was loud, higher pitched almost like a female scream but there was no strain to it.

My wife was laying down and trying to get some sleep in the back seat of the car since she had to work the next morning.  I normally work night shift so I had no problem staying awake to drive home. The oncoming traffic on the highway was spaced about one car every 3/4 of a mile to a mile with some farther apart so I couldn't use my high beams.  I'm a former Iowa police officer so I have a habit of periodically looking at the mile markers along the road so that if I have to call for help I can give a better idea of where we're at. I would say about a half mile or so after coming around the large curve southwest of Mineral Point, which I believe would be about mile marker 36, I was in the outside lane and I passed a large black figure standing upright on two legs where the grass meets the gravel on the inside shoulder of the median on my left. The headlights never hit it directly as I approached but the outside area of the light field lit it up as I passed it.  I'm 6'02\" and I was able to see the body from the ground up to the shoulder.  I would estimate the shoulder height to be around 6'06\" to 6'08\".  With the angle of the light beam and how low the car sits to the ground it looked like the head was shadowed by the shoulder so I wasn't able to see its face. The distance between us was about fifteen feet when I passed by.  I was able to see it's hand hanging down along the thigh and it was a lighter color and not midnight black like the color of it's body.  The thickness of it's body looking from the side, it's back to it's chest, was about two feet thick.  The fur or hair was hard to see do to the distance, the light conditions, and the speed of the car (cruise was set at 65mph) but it was short. I thought to myself, \"What was that?\" even though I know what it was and \"I didn't just see that.\" My immediate physical reaction was extreme anxiety.  My chest tightened and I made excuses to myself to not stop and look at it.  From what I saw I had no desire to stop. A couple miles passed while I tried to overcome the fear then I realized I need more facts on the conditions of the sighting.  I also felt that it was trying to cross the highway from the south that's why I didn't see it up ahead of me in the headlights.

We were on our yearly deer-hunting trip in the remote mountainous area of Randolph County. I was about 24 years old and was in on leave from the military on the family-hunting trip. My family and friends have hunted this area for many years and I was very comfortable and familiar with the area. The road back had not been traveled for years and was very washed out and overgrows with brush. It was about 7-8 miles back before we came to the impassable areas of the road and it was then that we geared up and proceeded on foot. I would estimate we had gone about another 2-3 miles on foot before we reached the crest of the mountain and decided to find our hunting spots. The light had just begun to peek over the mountaintop when I cleared my spot and settled in. I had worked up a pretty good sweat on the steady pace up the mountain so it was not too long after setting and listening to the first morning light waking up the rest of the forest, I began to nod off to sleep. After going in and out a few times I decided to get up and move around a little to try to wake myself up. After about 20 minutes of walking around I stumbled on a very old wooden tree stand. Although I could tell it had been there for many years, I remember thinking it was in the best spot overlooking the very visible and open woods just under the crest of the hilltop. Not too long after I ate the apples and oranges I had brought. After a while the warm morning sun took its toll on me and I nodded off again. A bad smell woke me right up. The forest was completely quiet around me and all I could think of is what the hell that awful smell is? As I became more alert, I could hear the slight rustling below me and what I thought was some faint grunts and whines. I decided it was time to lean over and get a visual on it. It was about 25 feet below me on the slope and directly in front of the stand. It was not aware of my presence above it. It was about 5 feet tall with long dark, reddish-brown hair. The hair from its head down its body was of equal length, about 2-3 inches long. The hair went down its arms and hands as well as its feet. I could barley see fingernails and toe nails. Not claws but nails like a human. Most of its hair was tangled and matted in spots as if it had wallowed the ground or a tree or something. I watched it smelling the orange peels and apple core then tasting them. It looked around at one point as if to wonder where they may have come from. I wondered how long it would be before it became aware of my presence and what it would do when it did. Then I heard the rustling coming down from the top of the hill, loud rustling, and I could tell something was coming at a pretty rapid speed. I saw the one below me turn and look in the direction of the noise. It froze for a few seconds and looked almost like a statue. I could not see at this point what was coming down the hill. I was leaning to my right and looking down. I tried to move my eyes to the left but my view was blocked by the trees that was holding up my stand and partially by the full-brim hat I was wearing. I kept my eyes moving between the one below me and the direction of the disturbance coming down the hill. As it moved toward our position it began to make noises like I have never heard before. I would ordinarily not be able to describe the noise but I have read where other people have described it as a record being played backward. I would have to say that is a very close description. It is as if it were speaking a language but nothing like I have ever heard before. The one below me sprang to its feet and then moved about 15-20 feet to the right of me. It moved very rapidly, kind of between a run and a leap, all on its feet though. It did not use its arms. It then started to bellow back at the one coming down the hill and it sounded almost like they were arguing. That is the impression that it left me with anyway. It wasn't until the one above me came into clear view that I started to feeling very scared. As it came into my immediate area it moved toward the first one and began to slow to what seemed to be very cautious movements. Its attention seemed to move between the first creature and its surrounding area. I felt at this moment that it was alert to my presence. This second one was much larger than the first and it seemed very irritated. The bigger one was covered in very dark hair, almost black. It was very muscular and its arms were noticeably long. It stood with a slight bend but an upright posture. I had to be about 8-9 feet tall. It was much larger than a human. As these two creatures squabbled (communicated?) back and forth their gestures were extremely human-like. I was under the impression that the larger of the two was scolding the smaller one. They moved about 40-50 feet to the right of me. At this point the larger one had its back to me I could make out facial features of the smaller one. It had very human-like features but a different nose. Hair covered most of its face but it looked to be thin hair, not like the rest of it. Then the smaller creature spotted me because it went into a crouched and then squatting position and looked up in my direction. Their chattering began to quiet and then the larger one, with its back still to me, went into a squatting position for a few seconds. The smaller one then began to howl and bellow very loudly. The larger of the one, with its back still toward me began to howl very loud also. The larger creature then pushed the smaller one and the smaller one sprang to its feet and rapidly ran off across the hill to my right. It ran in long leaping strides and moved very fast like nothing I had ever seen. I never noticed it to ever look back. As the smaller one ran the larger one stood up and slowly turned toward me. It had its arm bent above its forehead as if it were shading or hiding its eyes. It stood very straight and tall and looked directly at my tree stand. All of the fear from before overcame me again and I prayed that thing did not try to come up my tree. I thought for an instant that I would yell at it, jerk or jump and maybe frighten it away but I could not bring myself to move. I could not even bat an eye. I could feel my legs starting to shake and I became very hot all over. For an instant I though I was going to pass out or become physically ill. For a brief moment it was looking right at my face. From what I could see it had very large human-like eyes and very large round nostrils. I could not make out lips because of the hair on its face but I would guess that they were thin lips because the hair did not stick out. It did not have much of a protruding mouth or jaw like an ape. It had a flat fairly face like a human. It put its arm to its side and began to look around. It swiveled at the hips and looked in every direction. After a quick glance back at me it then began to walk off in the direction the smaller one had gone. It did not run or act scared at all. It made very long howls as it walked and turned a few times and looked in my direction as it walked away. I watched it and listened until it became just a black figure moving through the woods. I could here it howl and bellow for a few more minutes. Then I heard what sounded like something beating a tree or log with a limb or stick or something. After about 30 minutes I decided that if it meant to do me harm, it sure had the chance, and it was probably safe to get down out of the tree stand. I made my way back toward my friend that I had left earlier that morning. I never even thought to check the ground for evidence or anything. After about an hour I walked up on my friend and could see his blaze orange through the trees. I very carefully made my way in his direction. As I approached him I could see that he was staring at me. He was sitting against some downed trees and he did not move a muscle. As I walked closer to him I smiled and asked him if he had seen anything. He was very pale and I could tell he was a little scared and puzzled and then he answered to me the he was not sure what he had saw. I jokingly said, \u201cYou look like you saw a Bigfoot!\u201d and he jumped to his feet and asked, \u201cDid you see it?\u201d I nodded to him, yes, then he began to tell me what he saw. Apparently the larger creature had moved across the hill in front of him crashing through the trees about 40 to 50 yards away. He said at first he thought it was a bear but after observing it, he could plainly see that it was moving very fast and walking up right, like a man. I said we should try to track the two creatures but it really didn\u2019t take too much for him to talk me out of it.

My best friend had moved away from our neighbor hood in Beckley to Stanaford Acres in the spring. He had invited me to come out and spend the weekend with him in hopes of planning a fishing adventure down to Piney Creek. On Saturday morning, he and a common school friend of ours, and myself ,left out on foot at approx. 7:00am. With fishing gear,lunches and other necessities in hand, we made our way through the woods, past Kliningsmiths Pond, and over to the branch that would lead us to down to Piney Creek which was about a 3 mile hike. After spending the day fishing and doing things that teenage boys do we began to head back up the mountain. As we walked and talked, moving along the rail road that snakes its way through the gorge, it became apparent to us that we may not have been alone. Eerily we all had the feeling that someone, or something, was watching us, and following us from a distance. Paranoia began to set in, and we began to pick up the pace. By the time we reached the branch that we we're to follow back up the mountain,time was slipping away, and the thought of getting caught in the dark became apparent.After an hour or so of hiking up the branch, the sun had lazily rolled over the mountain top, and although it was still early, it was begining to get a little dusky in the hollow. We had just stopped to take a breather when we heard rustling on an old logging road about 300' feet above us. I had an old Red Rider BB gun with me, like it would have done any good, and it was rattling in my hands has they trembled. Maybe someone was watching us. Just in a matter of minutes, large boulders, the size of a washer or drier, came down, one after the other, headed right for us. We froze like stone statues, scared to death. After regaining our composure, we let up that hill side as though our feet were not even touching the ground. Thats when, against my better judgement, I turned to look back, just in time to see a large black shape disapear over the hillside. We ran all the way to Sams house, which was still a good mile and a half away. As the years went by, we looked back on that day and laughed at one another, joking about how scared each one of us were, and tried to come up with a reasonable explaination.

Basically, it was a weekend camp, hoping to spot game and look for trout water. Any thoughts of Bigfoot, (there had been previous reports) were largely in the back of my mind, although the prospect of possibly encountering or seeing evidence was exciting to consider. The area is quite remote, and the terrain fairly rugged. We had parked the truck on a forest service road, and hauled our gear into the woods. We spent the early afternoon scouting about, after pitching our tent in a small glen surrounded by pine trees. We spotted some deer and raccoon tracks along an adjacent small stream, and looked for whatever sign we could find, then headed back to camp. As we sat there, the atmosphere of such wilderness led my thoughts to Bigfoot. To amuse myself, I got up and started to peruse the woods a bit. About that time, I heard footsteps behind me and turned to see a couple of men walking down a trail carrying garbage bags on their backs. They stopped at our camp and my buddy and I talked with them a few minutes. They had been collecting ramps. Ramps are like wild onions. And they had a good haul, about 40 lbs worth between them. Half jokingly and half serious I asked them if they had heard tales of Bigfoot in the area. Their eyes kind of flew open for a second, then they gave me a look like I was crazy. They didn't say anything for a few seconds, then looked down at the ground, kind of averting their eyes. I quickly told them about the reports I'd read, but they seemed like they didn't want to discuss anything. We talked a bit more about ramp selling and Appalachian festivals and such; and I asked them where the ramp patch was and they told us it was on the backside of the hill fronting our tent. Soon they had to leave, but curiously enough, as they were walking away, one of the men turned and said, \"Y'all watch fer them Bigfoot now!\" in a matter-of-fact kind of way. Well, after awhile, my buddy and I decided to take a little foray up one of the trails, and had an enjoyable time--spotting hawks, many birds, bobcat sign, squirrels, and even a Great Horned Owl. We also heard a Barred Owl. We sat in the woods and talked, and planned to do some predator calling after nightfall. I think it was about six o'clock by this time, so we headed back to camp get something to eat. We rustled up some food without cooking anything and the sun was lowering, the night was soon to be coming on. We were debating where we should go try to predator call. Not long after, I head what I can only describe as howls and chatter-like sounds emanating from behind a hill. My buddy had gone back to the truck to get a flashlight we had left behind. As I listened, I could differentiate three separate sources for the sounds. It seemed like they were near each other, not calling to each other from a distance. I also noted that hound dogs were barking off to my right and in behind me from maybe a half-mile away. The howl-like sounds lasted only 30 seconds or so. I just sat there astounded. My buddy soon showed up, and I asked him if he had heard anything. \"Hound dogs\" he replied. I didn't say anything more to him about it, because I thought he might think I was gettin'nervy. Anyhow, I was primed for excitement that night. After supper, we sat up until late listening to the sounds of the night. Nothing unusual happened. Finally, went to sleep, but I'll admit I was catnapping most of the night. The next day passed much as the previous one, spotted wildlife and nice hike up to the \"plains\", and then back to camp. We milled about the camp area, and planned to predator call that night....After predator calling, without much response except for two owls, we cooked up some ramps and potatos and talked 'til about midnight. We never bothered to make a fire. After the day's hiking, a good sleep was welcome. About 2:30 a.m. I was awakened by the sound of our cookware being rattled. I lay there listening, and heard a buck snort. Then he stamped several times. The buck was after the ramps we had leftover from supper. Alright, I thought, back to sleep. I lay there waiting to drift off, listening to the buck mill about the camp. Then, I heard the buck snort loudly. Suddenly, I got an innate sense that something sizable was peering at the tent...I felt a presence there in the pines, which were about 15 feet away. The buck, after slowly moving away, finally bounded away from the glen. I fumbled around for the flashlight, not wanting to awaken my buddy. I couldn't locate it. Of course, I was still listening intently for whatever was there in the pines. I heard no movement. But that feeling of being scrutinized was raising the hair on my neck. I deliberated what to do. I had no weapon, except a machete. No means of startling what I felt had to be Bigfoot. It was just standing there, there was no discernable movement. I was 'paralyzed' as to what to do. Finally, I decided to do nothing, just lay there. I've had bears sniffing my tent and checking out my campsites before, and found that not confronting them is a good policy. I lay there waiting to see what would happen next. Maybe five minutes later, I heard tree branches moving and a few twigs snap. Then, nothing...I drifted off to sleep. Next morning, I awoke eager to check out the pine stand and campsite. I told my buddy about the buck visit, and decided to tell him about the strange presence lurking in the pines. He listened without saying anything. I wanted to look around, and evidently my buddy's curiosity got the best of him, and he joined the search. After a few minutes, I found a footprint. It was about 16 inches long and maybe 5-6 inches wide. The big toe was quite clear, and the other ones just slightly less defined. The big toe was maybe two inches wide. The soil where the footprint was dry, kind of grainy not loamy. It was hard-packed and there were pine needles surrounding. The footprint was visible but not deep in the soil. My buddy was quite intrigued by the footprint. We talked about what I had experienced, and dawdled over the footprint. But, it became evident my buddy didn't believe tht Bigfoot had made the footprint. Or better stated he wouldn't accept what he was looking at. He even smudged the toes to make it undiscernable. Of course, I was caught off guard by that and made somewhat peeved. Further thoughts: In retrospect, I feel kind of stupid for not having tried to look at the creature. At the time, I thought I was doing the right thing, it could have precipitated an attack. However, I could sense the largeness of what had to be Bigfoot. *I noticed the breathing,the inhalations of the creature as well, which further informed me of its size.", "location_details": "Occurred in the Dolly Sods Wilderness, which is north of Seneca Rocks on Hwy 55.

That's when the excitement of possibly having an encounter of my own hit me. I was traveling up a very steep and rocky ridge about 2 hours before daylight one Saturday morning. I was packing a tree stand and my bow. It was mid-october, and daylight would bring the opening day of bow season. I was on a very rugged ridge in Pendleton county; and I had taken several deer in the area in the past. After ascending the first half of my climb, I heard russling up the ridge in front of me. I shined my small mag light in that direction. There, about maybe 60 yards in front of me were about three or four sets of (Yellow) eyes. I noticed the one set of eyes go vertically several feet, still looking in my direction. Keep in mind that our deer are about 3 feet high at the shoulders at best. Plus, the encline was about a 1:1 ratio (or steeper than the nose on most peoples faces). I also noticed that two sets of eyes were very close together, and that one of those sets of eyes didn't loose contact with me when they run off. I kept anticipating a white tail as they moved off, or at least a snort. This is very common in our deer, even jumped up in the dark. This whole scenerio took maybe about 3 or 4 seconds. About 15 to 20 seconds after they had moved off, I remember something rather heavy falling near me. I just assumed at the time that it was something falling from an oak tree or something. I now think that it was instead something thrown at me. Another very short time lapse revealed some rather peculiar \"deer vocalizations\". By this time, the creatures of source at moved across a very deep/steep hollow from me. I remember thinking to myself that those sounds couldn't be coming from a deer or any other wild animal I have ever encountered. That included my hunting travels east and west. That's when the cold sweat broke out on me when I heard something very similar on the T.V. show. I would like to add that the area that I was in was in close proximity to where the encounters occurred at Dolly Sods. There is probably about a two thousand feet difference in elevation at where I was at; but it is only a few miles traveling across the Allegheney Mountains. If these creatures are known to eat white-oak acorns and wild fox grapes, then they would have been in business at that time of year, as they were fairly plentiful in that area. I also remember the skunky smell where I think they were bedded down.

I would say, I would have to see it to believe it. I love the woods and hunting. I spend as much time in these woods as possible and always have. I have never seen ANYTHING until now. I still have a hard time calling it a bigfoot. I have tried to rationalize it every way possible in my own mind. I can only come up with one conclusion; I saw and heard a \"Bigfoot\" It took me a long time to tell anyone other than my parents and wife. I know I have to report the sighting, so here goes. It was Saturday night at 11:30 pm, on January the 13th. It was raining, at times hard. I was driving south on route 55, coming up on Seneca Rocks, towing a U-Haul trailer driving about 45 mph. I had passed the gas station on the right, then the school on the left. Next on the left there is a brick house the government owns but never seems to use. This is just before the entrance to the park and the intersection to head to Harman, the direction I was headed. Passing the house is where I saw it. At first I thought it was a man in a special forces outfit, some type of sniper gear. My first thought was what is he doing out there on a night like tonight dressed like that. It was not really running more like a swaggering lope. It had long hair, what at first looked liked shredded material with clumps in it, hanging all off of its body. As I passed it I quickly noticed that it had this \"covering\" right up over its head. It seemed to have no neck, just a large head. I also realized it was very tall, and had very wide shoulders and its arms hung very low almost to its knees, if not below. It was walking or sort of trotting on hind legs like a man, but with a movement like an ape. It was only 20 feet or so from me. I realized it wasn't a man or anything else I had ever seen. I got a very good look at it. The whole thing still seems to have been in slow motion, It still plays in my head that way. In any case it hit me, what the Hell was that? I turned my truck trailer and all around within 50 yards right in the middle of the road. I pulled into the driveway and shined my headlights behind the house into the woods. I saw nothing. I pulled back onto the road and into the grass where I saw it. I stopped and shined my mag lite into the woods. It really got spooky. I heard it going through the brush. It made the noise you would expect a large creature to make. Then it seemed to be trying to scare me or get a reaction out of me, the way a deer will stomp its feet at you when it can't wind you. It made a type of laughing/squealing noise and a grunting noise. It pounded wood together, not a small piece hitting another piece. It was more of a large piece of wood being pounded on another large piece. This went on for 3 to 5 minutes then nothing. I was amazed. The next day I went back and combed the area. All I found was what appears to be footprints I took and still have pictures of them. What amazed me was, when I did go on the Internet on a friends advice, some other reported sightings were the similar including the sounds I heard.

We were backpacking in the Otter Creek Wilderness near Elkins WV. It was the first week of Jan. '07. It was unseasonably warm. We were out for about 4 days, 3 nights. The third night we were camping by Yellow Creek. It was Saturday night at about 4 30 pm. It was starting to get dark and we were working diligently to start a fire. It had rained on and off the entire time we were there so everything was wet. As I used a small log to hammer my hatchet through another log ( splitting kindling), I heard something howling way up the hollow. It was pretty far off by my estimation and at first I mistook it for a coyote. I kept hammering away as my buddy, who works for ODNR Div of Wildlife, was talking. He hadn't heard it. I then heard it again. The same call. This time something struck me as strange. It wasn't a coyote. There are several reasons I quickly came to this conclussion. The call was long and drawn out without the typical undulations and yipping associated with a coyote. It was also very far off. If it had been a coyote, it would have had to been at least 3 or 400 lbs. to produce that kind of volume. I stopped hammering. My friend looked at me and immediately asked what I was listening for. Then we heard it a third time. It resembled the scream of a woman ( for lack of a better comparison ). It was quite long, perhaps 5 or 6 secs start to stop. It definitely resembled a primate call of sorts. Coyote have never made the hair stand up on my neck before and I can identify about every call in the woods in this part of the country. I looked at him and asked if he could tell me what we had just heard. He said he could not and we both agreed neither of us had ever heard anything like that. I have heard similar recordings on websites devoted to the north american great ape theory aka; bigfoot. He and his fiance had also taken their dogs. She hadn't heard it but the dogs had been acting strange since we arrived at that campsite, several hours earlier. At one point they were barking at what seemed to be nothing. One of the dogs hair was standing on end from the base of his tail to the back of his neck as he sniffed the wind and repeatedly barked in the upwind direction. This was about an hour before we heard the call. It was still daylight and we saw and heard nothing. It was obvious to me that whatever he was smelling was scaring him. After going to our tents for the night and the fire had burned down, I heard more noises closer to camp. It sounded as if someone was stomping around in the rotodendrin and was not trying to be quiet at all. I also heard branches snapping and they sounded pretty large.

I considered it all to be a hoax. I am a student studying wildlife biology. The following happen in West Virgina, Pocahontas County, near the Monongahela National Forest. MeadWestVaco owns and operates 3413 hectares in the Allegheny Mountain range for logging and ecological reseach. It is gated and not open to the public see website.  I was participating in a study project studying the distribution and breeding success of songbirds in forest cutting sites. The study was headed by West Virgina University. My job was to search for bird nest of particular species and track their progress from egg to fledge. I was familiar with every kind of bird in the area by call, as it was one of my job requirements and hobbies. I was just coming down from the top of this ridge in a clear cut area with many downed trees, slash and new growth only about waist high. I heard the strangest sound coming from above on a ridge or rock outcropping about 100 yards above. It was a \"whooping\" sound. It was very loud vocalization. Its sound was resonating through the whole valley below and carrying very far. The only sound I could match it to was a monkey call in a tropical forest (which I have never experienced). It was a very alarming call, and I assumed it was some kind of bird that I have never seen or heard before. I scanned the trees, bushes and rocky outcrop for a silhouette of a bird with my binoculars but did not spot anything. The call lasted for about 3 to 4 minutes. The \"whooping\" was repetitive, about 15  \"whoops\" and then a pause, and then 10 to 15 more about 4 sets in all. It felt like it lasted a long time. The entire time I was scanning the vegetation looking for a bird. It was so loud and deep I often thought it couldn't be a bird but it was my only conclusion. When it stopped I made my way up to the spot where It was coming from. It took me about 10 minutes to walk along logging trails and through vegetation to get there. Once I got to the summit of this ridge it flatted out. I remember seeing many game trails and beaten paths. This was common in some areas due to heavy use by deer. I started walking around looking into the trees which consisted of Eastern Hemlock and mixed hardwoods. I heard nothing. It was strangely quiet, like everything was scared off from the call. I traversed the slope very excited that I may see possibly an invasive species of bird, but when I got to the top of that ridge I felt very uneasy. I cant explain it. I never wanted to go back up to that spot after this incident. I wrote down exactly what I heard. When I went back to camp that evening, I told the ornithologists what I had heard and they said the only bird that makes such a loud and similar sound as that was a Yellow-billed Cuckoo. I listened to sound recordings of the Yellow-Billed Cuckoo that night and quickly realized that was not the sound I heard. I also called my father, an avid birdwatcher and told him about it. Then last month I watched a program on the Discovery Channel about Sasquatch.To reiterate, I was not a believer at that time and am still borderline. Watching the program peaked my interest to search online. I came across this website. I noticed that an expedition was done in almost the same spot where I had worked, just further north. I also listened to the audio recordings from  the Berry-Morehead Expeditions in the 1970's from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. When I listened to the \"Whoops and Knocks\" audio clip it was the exact call I had heard but in a different sequence. I was, and still am floored and in awe. The only thing that stops me from believing it was a Sasquatch is not knowing anything about the authenticity of that recording, but I am certain it was that same kind of \"whoop\".", "location_details": "Private property.

I had gotten to the area shortly after 3:00pm that evening, and after parking my vehicle in the \"Camp 70\" parking area I hiked up what appeared to be an old logging trail directly behind the parking area. I had already gotten a late start and wanted to get afield as quickly as possible, so I decided to stalk along the logging trail until I got further into the river bottom. After hunting the trail for roughly 30 minutes I was able to see a long distance in the river bottom to my right, so I decided to move into the bottom in hopes a deer would emerge from the thick along the river at dusk. I came across another \"road\" after leaving the logging trail, so I started walking further into the valley on it. The road was frozen and crusted over due to the cold temperatures, which made traveling quietly impossible, so after a short distance I found a small group of trees a few yards from the trail and set up in them. Shortly after arriving I heard what sounded like brush breaking 150 - 200 yards below me, towards the river. I readied myself in hopes it was a group of deer moving into the flats to feed, but nothing appeared. A few minutes passed by and I heard the sound again, and again, nothing materialized. I decided to move closer, and positioned myself in another group of small trees 100 yards or so below my first site. I had been in this grove of saplings for 5 - 10 minutes when I caught movement in a cluster of trees that was about 80 - 90 yards below me and to the left. I could see the movement with my naked eye, and immediately upon seeing it I scoped the group of trees and to my surprise saw nothing. A few minutes went by and I caught the movement again, I quickly scoped the trees, and this time I was shocked by what I saw. At first I thought it was a large man, as the first thing I saw through my scope was a vague silhouette, but when my eyes focused I could see what appeared to be a primate-like creature standing upright and staring directly at me. It only broke it's stillness to slightly move the upper portion of it's body in an up and down motion. It would bend it's knees as if it was going to sit down, then immediately straighten back up. This went on for what seemed to have been over a minute, then the creature exited the group of tree's and moved to my left (the creature's right), towards the mountain behind me. It walked across an expanse of river basin that I would guess to be 70 - 80 yards long before entering the timber and exiting my field of view. It kept watching me the whole time it was walking, only breaking it's stare on me a few times to look directly ahead of it. I initially thought of attempting to locate it's track's, but my nerves got the best of me and I started moving towards the parking lot as quickly as I could. Though the creature never actually made any threatening movements, I didn't feel safe enough to continue hunting and remain in the valley any longer after the sun went down than I had to.

To begin with I am a 40 year responsible adult male and I have not told anyone about these encounters or experiences that I have had for fear of being ridiculed and/or being labeled as loony by my friends, family and the community. I found this website many years ago on my own by accident and was surprised to read about others who had the same experiences as I had. I finally found the courage to tell you what had happened to me. I have been in and lived near the woods all my life. In my family hunting is a tradition. All the animal noises and natural sounds of the woods I know and am familiar with and have honed over time a very acute sense and perception that most hunters have or any outdoors man would have honed. I would go sqirrel hunting often after work along some railroad tracks that ran just a quarter of a mile from my home at the time. One late fall afternoon I was just walking with my .22 mag rifle at the ready quietly along the tracks when I heard a noise or a rustling of leaves in the woods when I suddenly stop and stood motionless while I scanned the woods with my eyes looking for the source of the noise thinking it my be a large gray or fox squirrel. After awhile I did not hear nothing more so I moved on. Now I have hunted alone many times and had never been afraid of anything but just after I had moved on I began to hear what sounded like foot steps in the woods just behind me and parelling me 50 to 75 ft. away. At first I thought of deer or a dog or a person walking up in the woods and after a few minutes I decided to call out to who ever may be there and let them know that I was where I was there for safety precautions. Well there was no reply and I called out a couple more times just to be sure. No reply. So as it was about 1/2 hour before sunset I was compelled to call it quits for that day and head back to my truck which was parked about a mile back near the RR. Whatever it was proceeded to follow me keeping pace with me at a parallel distance of 50 ft. It became more and more clear that what ever it was was heavy and big for several times along the way back I heard loud heavy branches breaking and heavy footfalls that I know could not have been a deer or bear (there has not been a bear seen in the area that I was hunting for as long as I can remember nor have I had ever found any sign of one in that area.). Every time I would stop it would stop and when I moved it moved this when on until I came to the area near where my truck was parked and was an opened field. Whatever it was followed me right up to where the wood line was about to end and the field begin. The other encounter happened in the same area only a year or two later and this time the unknown animal was shadowing me on the other side of the tracks between the tracks I was on and the river. There was a heavy growth of rhododendron bushes that ran the entire length of the shelf of land that was about 50 yards wide from the river to the tracks. There is an embankment that is an accent of 75 ft. from the rhododendron bushes to the tracks above where I was at. I could see the wake that this thing was making from time to time through the rhododendron bushes for it was right in the middle of them as it was keeping up with me, which was remarkable to me how it did that without exposing itself in some manner, but again I thought through all the possibilities of what it could be for there are few animals that would follow you for a mile stopping and starting in sync with your every step. I never saw any part of it as it moved through the brush and even though I could see a wake made by the branches as it moved through the thick brush it was only here and there, mostly it was if a large contortionist where moving through the heavy with the brush with the utmost of ease. The third time was near spruce knob in Pocahontas County, WV while on a field trip for a summer class I was taking in the spring of 2003 some of my fellow classmates and I were outside one night trying to call in Bard Owls. After some minutes later we heard a few in the pine trees near our camp returning our calls. We were having fun with our success with calling them in and after 30 minutes we had called in 4 or 5 more in the pine trees that bordered the road across the road from our camp. Then all of a sudden while in the act of making more calls we heard a huge commotion up on the hill about 75 yards. from us it sounded like a couple of huge guys romping around and making the Bard Owl call, we all stood there trying to make out what it was but could not see anything. Someone shined a flashlight in the direction of the sounds and they ceased immediately. We did night hear anything more on that hill that night.

She suddenly grabbed my grandfathers leg and whispered \"Benny, there\u2019s something in that window\". My grandfather looked at the window and calmly went into his bedroom. He called my father and uncles in after him. I got up and went in also as my granddad was taking guns off the rack and he said, \"There is something at that back window; we got to run it off\". My dad and his brothers smiled at each other, thinking it was a joke until granddad loaded his double barrel 12ga (paw-paw did NOT play with guns).

My husbands uncle and a friend were frog gigging on this farm, that we have now lived on for the last 10 years. (It is my father-in-laws land, which has been in the family for over 30 years.)  He said that they just crossed the creek that is directly behind our mobile home (of course our home wasn't here at the time!).  They heard a noise about 30 feet down the creek. It was nightime, so they shined their lights in the direction of the noise.  They saw a animal creature bending down at the creek, drinking water out of its hands. The \"animal\" stood up, on two legs like a man, was gray, and hairy all over.  It then took off up the holler, running on two legs like a man.  It was no bear.  A bear wouldn't run like a human does. My husbands uncle and friend immediately left, they were so scared. Now lets skip to the early 1990's.  My husband and I move a mobile home in on the farm.  For the first time in many years, someone has finally occupied this land.  Our first summer here, in 1991, I would hear all sorts of noises.  Being from the suburbs, and not used to nighttime country noises, I didn't know what they were, and always kept the windows shut, no matter how hot it was inside. I felt like something was just \"out there\". We have always heard weird things over the years. Now lets skip 10 years to this past June 2001. My kids, ages 13, 11, 9 and 6 were playing in the field, out behind our mobile home.  They came in, wanting my camera. They said they found \"footprints\".  I laughed it off, and told them just don't take too many pictures. They took the pictures, I forgot about them for about 3 weeks.  When I went to get the pictures developed, I was shocked at the footprints!  They are nothing like I've seen before. About a week later, the end of June 2001, my kids were playing again, at the creek that runs behind the field, that is behind our mobile home.  Our dog was with them.  All of a sudden they hear something running across the hillside, sounding as if it was tearing down trees as it went. The dog ran after it.  Whatever it was, kept on running, with our dog on its trail.  We then heard the dog start yelping, crying like whatever it was got him. I was too scared to go and see if he was ok.  We waited for him to come back. He did several hours later, covered in some kind of slimy stuff. Like slobber. He was ok, but never did find out what that stuff was. I had told the kids not to go down to the creek again, till we find out what is up on the hill.  Of course, being kids, they didn't listen.  They took off on the hill, to see if there were any small trees or shrubs knocked down by whatever ran through the woods the day before.  They weren't up there very long, before huge rocks down tumbling down the hill at them.  It was like something or someone was up there actually throwing huge rocks at them. I am talking rocks that are bigger than a persons head.  They came running back down the hill. Two days later, around 9 am, I had all the windows open to our mobile home.  Everyone but me was still in bed. I heard a very loud, long growl. I have never heard this sound before in my life.  The dogs, which were sleeping in the yard heard it, and took off on the hill after whatever it was. Over the years, there have been unexplained things and noises happening.  This past winter (around Jan. 2001), something hit the side of our mobile home in the middle of the night. It was like someone had taken a ballbat and smacked the side of the wall where our bedroom is as hard as they can.  We have hiked on the hill, and heard unidentified loud growls.  At night there have been screams and growls.  My husbands uncle, the one who had sighted the \"animal\" in the 1970's had lived in a small shed on our farm in the mid' 1990's.  He would work late shift and come home in the middle of the night. He would have to walk 1/4 of a mile to the shed. He would tell us all the time how creepy it was to walk up the holler at night.

They took their 4 wheeler back to the second field that is just behind the one it has been seen in.  The waited for it to walk in.  After some time of sitting they started to smell a horrible stench. My brother stood up to look in the woods behind them and he saw the creature squatting down behind a tree.  My brother then moved to get a better look at it when it stood up and left.  He then went to look for it and saw it foot imprint on some leaves on the ground, he said they weren't very good but he could see that its foot prints where about 5 feet apart. My older brother, his wife and 6 year old son were riding on their 4 wheeler back in old 93 hollow.  It was between 7:00pm - 8:00pm when they saw what they thought to be a black bear walking on its hind legs.  They stopped the 4 wheeler and turned off the engine to watch it. When they did this the creature also stopped and was watching them.  My brother and His wife saw the creature and they looked at each other over a distance of around 200 feet for about 2 minutes.  My sister-in-law described it to me this way.  When it turned to face us, I could see through its legs.  Its legs were not touching together.  Its arms hung down its side just above its knees, and its shoulder and mid drift were real broad.  It had fur from head to toe. Two minutes later the creature took off into a stride across the field with its arms swinging at its side and a slight bend to its form.   At the end of the field it turned and went into the woods.  At that distance they could see it as it walked through the woods.  They figured it to be about 8 - 9 feet tall.  They said it could not have been a bear walking on its hind legs covering the distance it covered in the short time it covered it.   They watched it enter into the woods and then went home.  When they got home their son, scared from what he had just seen, started crying.  He swore to his mom he was never going to ride his bike or motor bike in that hollow ever again. The next day my brother took my younger brother and my uncle back in the hollow with him to see if they could find any tracks this creature had made.  They searched but did not find any, it was over grass and it rained most of the night.  So my older brother gave up and went home leaving my younger brother and my uncle in the hollow.  Shortly after my younger brother and uncle saw the creature.  They were in the same location as my other brother was the night before.  They watched it come out of the wooded area about 400 yards below them and cross the road.  It went down the a hill into a valley where they couldn't see it.  Then suddenly it came up on the other side of the hill and walked along side the edge of the field and entered the wooded area where it did (or another) the night before.  My brother got to see it through his binocular and said it looked like a pro basket ball player but much more muscular with fur from head to toe.  He said all he could see was its back side and it wasn't anything he had ever seen before.  My brother also said he yelled at it but it didn't faze the creature at all. Two days later, in the morning my older brother and his wife went to the same area to go mushroom hunting.  They were in the power lines when they heard a loud knocking on one side in the woods, like someone hitting something on a tree.  Across on the other side, where one old dilapidated house was, they heard something screaming.  My brother described it as a high pitch hunting dog scream.  They said this went on continuously.  My brother started to walk down toward the house to see what it was.  The closer he got the more it spooked him, so he went back and got on his 4 wheeler leaving his wife on top of the power lines.  His wife said when he started up his 4 wheeler and headed down the road toward the house the knocking got louder and the screaming got louder and more intense.  She said the one that was in the woods knocking started crashing through the woods in the direction that she was in, then stopped when it heard the 4 wheeler turning back.  My brother, who turned around because the screaming was so loud he heard it over his loud 4 wheeler, then got his wife and left the area shaken up a little.  They didn't think the creature would be there in the morning, they thought they slept during the day or something. They and other people have gone back to the same area in the two days since the last encounter and nothing was found or heard.", "location_details": "Marion County West Virginia.

I heard \"very close\" moaning or howling from our open bedroom window of our home around 3:45 in the morning. The howling and noise woke me from a sound sleep. I could not get my husband awake who was sound asleep at this time, I tried quietly. The howling or moaning at first sounded like that of another type of animal in pain (more like a large pig or cow at first) but changed to sound like something \"very large\" in size and getting very upset (VERY deep, angry tone growls). I did some research before contacting you and I have heard what bear sound like on various recordings. As well as, other type of animal recordings. This animal in no way sounded like that of a bear or anything else I have heard in the past. Finding your web site and listening to the recordings of moaning and such brought chills up my back!!! They sound so familiar to that night but I still cannot be certain. We have a small spaniel mix dog that sleeps in our basement garage area located under our home. Upon hearing the howling outside that night, the dog moved to the garage door area located directly under the bedroom window and barked like being startled from sleep three times. I could tell, the creature I had heard moaning and howling moved to the garage door under our open bedroom window (which is two stories high) and growled \"very deep\" at our barking dog while \"striking or smacking\" above the garage door. The dog STOPPED barking! Then I heard nothing out of our dog or from the animal outside the window again that night. I was too frightened to move and look outside. For a long time prior to this I had a strange unexplained feeling of \"being watched\" while being outside on our homes patio. This patio faces pretty dense wooded area on three angles back there. Something just made me feel uncomfortable even in daylight hours out there that I had not felt before since moving here. Although a bit odd, I no longer have this same feeling. On two different nights prior, I couldn't sleep and heard what sounded like small rocks hitting the brick outside of our home close to our bedroom area. I assumed it was just the home settling while the temperature was cooling down in the late evenings.

This is about a 500 acre patch of hardwoods that borders the Kentucky Turnpike. We always camped in an old abandoned barn right off Nelsonville Rd just a few miles out of Boston. It was a cool November afternoon and we had decided to do some scouting. We had walked a set of railroad tracks about a mile back into the middle of the area we always hunted. We made our way off the tracks and were slowly working thru the woods. The area is mainly gentle rolling hills and bottoms. We were spread out about 100 yards apart and had just topped a small ridge. About 200 yards down in the next bottom something caught my eye. I noticed something black moving quickly through the woods and it was out of site in a matter of seconds. I thought it was pretty odd as there were no bears in this area of the State back then. And we had never noticed any farm dogs or other livestock this far back in the woods. When we met on the tracks to head back to camp I asked my buddies if they had noticed anything strange while scouting and neither of them had seen anything. I casually mentioned what I had seen and left it at that. Later that evening back at the barn, we had finished supper and had turned in to our sleeping bags to call it a night. It was cool and clear and the local farm yard dogs were carrying on pretty good and the katydids were really putting up a fuss. As the area was really loaded with fox and everything seemed to be pretty active I decided to try and call one up from inside the barn. I pulled the cellophane off a pack of smokes and squeezed it between my thumbs and started a series of calls, sounding like a rabbit distress call. This tactic had worked well for us in the past. This evening it worked a little too well. After about 5 minutes of me screaming on the call the local dogs were really worked up good and sounding off like crazy. What happened next, I\u2019ll never forget till the day they lay me in the ground. From way off in the distance a low moan started up that grew into a load mournful roar that sent shivers down my spine. We all sat up in silence for a few seconds and noticed that not a single dog or katydid was making so much as a peep. The woods had become dead silent. Not believing what we\u2019d just heard I let out one more blast of calls from the makeshift varmit call. Again it started up low and grew into that same roar like sound. This time really put the fear of the Lord in us all. My buddies were begging me to stop and it really didn\u2019t take too much convincing. The hair on the back of my neck and arms was standing straight up and goosebumps had come up all over me. I put the cellophane away and got as deep down in my bag as I could. None of us said another word and sleep was nearly impossible. We all three lay in that barn dead silent till morning light.  Needless to say not a one of us dared head out that next morning in the darkness for any deer hunting. We got up, packed and headed out of there as fast as we could.  I was 17/18 years old at the time and had spent nearly all of this time in the woods and on the water and had never ever heard anything like what we did that night. I am now 48 and have moved off to another State but still spend every possible minute I can in the woods. To this day I have never heard anything like we did that night until I came across your website. When I listened to the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County Ohio chills ran down my spine. Absolutely 100% no doubt that this was the EXACT same sound we heard coming from the patch of woods that night. My wife and kids think I have lost it when I tell this tale to them and play that recording back over and over to them.

April, 1990, rural Marshall County, I was attempting to make a residential delivery.  While walking up the gravel drive I noticed a flock of birds flying overhead coming from the direction of a thick grouping of trees in the back of a field to my left.  They were chattering loudly and flying wildly in what seemed to be a race.  As they got closer I noticed that there were different speices flying together...Blue Jays, Caridnals, Black Birds, Finches, etc...This struck me as odd for a moment.  When I reached the steps to the porch of the home I heard the thunder of hooves hitting the ground and turned and saw many horses that were in the field come running from the edge of the forest towards the house, they too where whinnying and making alot of commotion.  Before I could really think anything about it, I saw several deer leeping from the thick trees and running thru the fields away from the same spot, and behind the horses.  My first thought then was that there was a fire!  I hurried to the residence door and knocked very hard and repeatedly, while scanning the sky for any signs of smoke.  No one answered.  Having delivered here before I thought the occupant might be around back in the barn so I left the porch and turned to walk in that direction, that's when I heard the most terrifying sound in my entire life that I knew could not have been human or from any known animal in this area. The sound came from the thick group of trees and echoed over the fields in thick vibrations.  It was a mixture of a deep lions growl that hightened into a scream containing the same low, deep, loud rhythym.  I stood stunned, half scarred and half curious.  From the area of the trees where the sound traveled from was the figure of something very tall, very large in width and very strong, as some of the smaller pine trees about 10 to 15 feet in height were being shaken back and forth vigorously and violently.  The figure itself was not totally visible but hidden mostly behind the shadows of the larger trees behind and around it.  It was dark in color, guessing dark brown or black, with a thick furry outline.  It looked to have stood well over 7 feet in height. It began moving along the edge of the trees towards the house, just keeping inside the safety of the shadows.  The horses in the pasture where on the far right hand side now, rising up and hitting the fence with their hooves.  This was too much excitement for me, and I turned to run to my truck.  That hideous sound came thru the air again, but this time it was much closer than before,  I quickly made it into the truck, started the engine and left very rapidly.(Half way expecting the engine to be flooded or the battery dead, like in some lame horror movie.) This event left me pretty shaken, but it was also my duty as a courier to return to the home the next day to reattempt the delivery.  Upon reaching said home, I briefly explained to the occupant what occured the day before, expecting him to start laughing.  To my surprize, he only agreed that there had been some strange sounds coming from 'those neck of the woods' lately, and that his horses were frequently 'spooked' by something in the area.  He also stated that a friend of his had took his hunting dog back there a few weeks prior to this incident and that the dog took out after something, disappeared from sight, let out  curdling yelping sounds, then went quiet.  He said his buddy found what was left of the dog, it's head was not to be found, and that there had been a fowl ordor around the area at the time.  He further insisted it was probably a 'bobcat' or something and never suggested anything else, except not to 'go in them there woods' by myself. Not to worry, I had no intentions of it.", "location_details": "Go west of Benton, Ky on Mayfield Hwy, also called Hwy 58, about 2 miles from the new 4 lane Hwy 641, turn right on Houser Rd, go another mile and turn left on Cole Cemetery Rd.

So I stood up and grabbed a piece of wood (we just built their deck so there are pieces laying around) and hit the hand rail of the deck 3 times very slow.

My husband and I have a cabin located in rural Lee County, KY.  It\u2019s a primitive cabin, no electricity, no phone, hand pumped water, no neighbors, etc.  My husband was visiting friends about 8 miles away.  Just after dark, I was sitting inside, reading a book, when I heard what sounded like two logs being hit against one another...making a loud, hollow \u201cknocking\u201d noise.  The \u201cknocking\u201d happened 3 or 4 times in a row...then it paused...\u201dknocked\u201d again 3 or 4 times in a row...and this was repeated for about 15-20 minutes.   I looked outside but didn\u2019t see a thing.  You can\u2019t hardly see your hand in front of your face at our cabin, unless the moon is out...and it wasn\u2019t.  Just a few minutes after the \u201cknocking\u201d stopped, someone or something threw what sounded like a handful of gravel onto the tin roof of the cabin.  We have oak trees around our property but the branches were mostly bare at that time and they don\u2019t hang over the roof...so nothing could have fallen from them onto the roof. Needless to say, I was scared to the bone and didn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t make myself go outside.  My husband left one of his guns at home for protection and I sat on our bed, with the gun next to me facing the door until he got home. When he did get home...I told him what happened.  He went outside and shot his shotgun off into the woods about 10 times.  Later this same evening, he heard something rustling around outside so he went out the front door and shot his .45 off about 12 times into the woods behind the cabin where the noises came from. The next morning, he went outside to take a shower...(we have an outdoor shower behind the cabin)...and he found one of the bullets from the .45 sitting straight up, in the middle of the shower floor like someone just walked over and set it there.  The bullet wasn\u2019t deformed in any way...it didn\u2019t look like it had hit or gone through anything other than the rifling.

I have had 2 encounters in my lifetime with, what i believe to be, bigfoot/sasquatch. I have told people i have had the encounters, but i have never told any of the details, mainly because I knew no one would believe me if I did. The second encounter, I never really saw the creature, but i know it was there...my first encounter was quite the opposite. i saw the creature up close for at least a few minutes, it was in short, terrifying. My second encounter happened while i was ginseng hunting in late summer. i was right on the outskirts of daniel boone national forest at the rowan/lewis county line in ky just a few hundred yards from cranston rd. i had been in this holler making my way up to the ridge looking for roots for about an hour or so when i heard some brush move about 50 to 75 yrds up the hill from me. i strained hard to see what had made the noise, thinking it may be a deer or maybe even an elk or bear, but saw nothing. As i continued my zig-zag pattern towards the top of the ridge, I heard the noise again. i looked again and saw a flash of black and the brush moved slightly. My next thought was \"bear\" and not having a firearm with me, i decided it would be best to start back down the hill. as i did, i kept an eye on the area I had seen the movement and to my horror, I realized it was following me down the hill all along making sure it stayed hidden. I could see glimpses of black and the brush and branches move the whole time I was retreating. I know that there is the possibility it was a bear, but what made me so uneasy is the fact that the brush and branches this thing was disturbing were 5 to 6 feet off the ground! knowing that black bears only stand around 3 feet high on all fours and knowing that bears don't move far on two legs (much less several hundred yards) I really believe what was following me down the hill was a bigfoot. my first encounter was in lawrence county ky when i was around 8 years old...i know it was a long time ago, but I know what I saw and i will never forget it as long as i live. we were staying with relatives (I'm not sure of the exact location now) in an isolated holler between two hills with no other houses around. there were quite a few people there and the little house didn't have adequate sleeping room, so we put sleeping bags on the floor in the rooms and my cousins and I slept in the floor beside their parents bed. i have always been the first person awake no matter where i sleep and this morning was no different. It was just breaking daylight, the windows in the bedroom were open because it was hot there in august. As i lay there wondering what we would do that day, i saw a figure pass by outside the window next to the bed. My first thought was someone was up and had to run outside for whatever reason, but as soon as that thought was finished, the figure was looking in the open window by the dresser. Words cannot describe the horror i felt. I had never heard of bigfoot at that time, so i was sure king kong was standing outside looking through the open window. I stayed frozen with fear, knowing if the beast saw me watching, it would attack (that was my thought anyway). The next thing i knew, it reached its arm through the window and grabbed a piece of jewelry from off the dresser. the noise it made caused one of the adults to switch positions in the bed and like a shot, it was gone. I told everyone what had happened and they told me it had been around there for years and not to be afraid, because it had never harmed anyone or anything and that it was more afraid of me than I was of it. I don't know about that, but i do know what i saw.

I don't recall exactly where along that highway I was at the time, somewhere after three lanes had been reduced to two. And it happened 4-5 years ago, in 1999 or 2000. I don't recall what time of year it was, maybe autumn. It never occured to me to report it, and I just found this site so I thought I'd let you decide if it has any merit. It was late, between 1-2 AM, and I was heading back to Winchester, KY (20 miles E of Lexington on Interstate 64) after a visit to PA. No other traffic was on the road at the time I sighted what appeared to be a large animal standing in a recess along a road cut, which I wouldn't have seen but for my headlights; there were no street lights or other sources of light. It stood erect and was covered in dark fur like a bear, which I imagined it must be, but it had no muzzle like a bear. I wondered if it could have been an elk because it was the right height, but I couldn't reconcile an elk with the other body features. It was only in view for 3-4 seconds and was not moving, only looking directly at my car as I sped by. I passed within 15-20 feet of it. I looked directly at it, and it had an angry expression on its face. It made my hair stand on end. I usually didn't travel via Cincinatti when I lived in Winchester (I live in Lexington now), and in subsequent trips along that stretch of road I have been unable to find the exact spot at which I sighted it. Perhaps the roadway has since been modified to eliminate overhanging rocks; there has been a lot of road work along that stretch in the last few years. And I've wondered if it was just the play of shadows from my headlights that gave the illusion of something standing there, but the shape of a shadow changes as the light source moves, and this figure did not change. I was not sleepy; I work a night shift so I'm usually awake at that time. I'm reasonably certain I saw something, just not sure what. In summary, whatever I saw was 6-6.5 feet tall, dark brown to black fur, bipedal posture, angry demeanor. And it appeared to be holding its arms/paws up at shoulder height, as though it were a tree, or stiking some pose intended to frighten me, which was very effective. My initial impression was that it struck a very human posture. I heard no sound and it it not move.

I lived in a small hollow with a partically graveled lane that dead ended at my driveway. The land is hills with pine oak and other common eastern Kentucky trees and brush growth. Land has strip mines with several ponds scattered through it, there are houses, and small farms, (just family type farms).  In 1980 we - my wife and 5 children - moved to the undeveloped 50 + acres. That was my wife's father's until his death in 1973. We had lived there for about two or three months when I started hearing things that made me a little uncomfortable but not frightened. There were nights the dogs would bark and carry on but would not go after what ever it was they were barking at.  And we would even run and hide when it would come to close to the house. I asked a couple of the neighbors and they would not discuss it saying it is just a deer or a bear.  Yes there were deer and even a bear killed within a mile or so of the area, but any type of hunter would know that this was very unlikely, but not impossible. I hunted and walked in the woods a lot just to enjoy the cooler tempatures of the forest and to just be out alone. While I was hunting I noticed a few things that wasn't what I call natural forest happenings (for lack of a better word). I had not heard of markers of bigfoot territory but I saw what I thought was the work of a few of the local boys out in the woods playing. But as I looked at the three large trees that was leaned on another tree to form a teepee structure without a covering, the question always came to mind, \"Why would anyone want to drag those trees up to here and lean them on that tree?\" You could see they were not a natural fall or a accident, It was a diliberate structure that was constructed by someone. There was also small trees  that were twisted almost in two at from four to six feet off the ground.  These were not caused by the wind but by using two hands to twist as you would wring out a cloth. I never saw any footprints but once when the dogs were acting up at something in the woods, and just about twenty yards up the hill, I went after it with a 30 30 rifle. It was about 11:00 at night, it was probably in early winter or late fall, there was a skift of snow on the ground, mostly in spots on the hill.  After I walked around the hills for about a mile to a mile and a half not getting any closer or able to see what I was after even though it stayed about twenty or thirty yards ahead of me.  I could never see it, but I could hear it walking in the leaves and breaking branches. I decided to just go on to the house.  The next morning I walked up on the hill to see what kind of tracks I could see. I found my tracks in the snow and where I had tripped a couple of times on vines growing in the leaves on the ground. But I could not find any indication of anything that was walking in front of me or any place around me. I have seen eyes that looked blood red, and another time green, as they were looking at me from the low underbrush at night.  While setting on the porch at night I would hear what at the time I thought sounded a little like an old steam locomotive whistle. But not guite the same they were always a long way off in the hills. My wife at the time (now divorced) saw what she  described as an old Indian men looking through the window at her.  I was not there at the time, but she did call the Kentucky state police.  There were no foot prints so they said she probably saw her own reflection and I guess just dissmised it. She said she saw it from the mid chest up. The bottom of the window is at least six feet six inches off the ground, I'am six feet and I had to use an 8 inch block to see over the bottom edge of the window. One night we were leaving to go into Ashland. As we were getting into the truck we heard someone on the hill whistling, I called out to see who it was but there was no reply, just more whistling.  I told them I had a gun and would shoot if they did'nt answer.  There was no answer, and I fired a shot in the general direction and the whistling stopped.  But there was no reply.  It just started to walk around the hill, I fired another shot in the air but it did not speed up or slow down. I got in the truck and we left. I never had a sighting but all these things and a few more such as throwing of rocks and pieces of wood  has convinced me there is something that is intelligent enough to stay so close and still so undetected is living within our back yards.  These things happened in the early eightys and the place has changed, but I think it is still alive and healthy. The Greenup County sighting prompted me to send this to you as that was just a few miles over the hills.

I was shocked to see so many in KY and was completely floored when I saw a report not only in my same county but on the abandoned property behind my farm.  The report was from 1993 I think but our first sighting was in 2006. In 2006 my then 4yr old daughter told me that she saw Monkeys at the edge of my field as she was riding in my wifes car down our driveway.  She said There was a big one and a smaller one.  They both had red eyes and the bigger one looked like it was waving.  I asked her how big and she said the biggest one was a lot bigger than me (I'm 6'4\" 200lbs) and it was real hairy.  I dismissed it as a childs imagination but always kept it in mind because the description matched stories I had heard as a teenager about a big foot type creature in Lawrenceburg known as \"Howdy\" because he waves.

As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn't long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn't sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn't say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground. Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn't taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3\". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6'4\" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4\" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not  understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let's go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us, light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn't mind, thinking I had a way of escape.

My girlfriend's father was sitting on the hood of the car with his fishing pole in front of him.  He was night cat-fishing.  While we sat there, with the car lights shining across the river, my girlfriend and I were sitting in the front seat just making small-talk (honest), when all of a sudden I heard the most horribly incredible scream coming from my right side.  To set the scene:  Our car was parked about two feet from the water, on the bank.  Off to my right about 60 feet was where the foliage began. Very swampy, very thick, and very hard to walk through.  About 40 feet further up the bank (which can't be seen from our car because of the foliage) is a huge oak tree.  I'd have to guess that the tree had about a 15 foot circumference - massive!  About 10 feet up the tree is a huge branch that went about 20 feet out over the river.  My friends and I would climb the tree and jump/dive into the river at least once every couple of weeks or so.  During one occasion, there were about 9 of us standing on this branch attempting to make it move - we barely made it do anything, let alone shake! Anyway, back to the car. As I heard the scream, my body instantly went into what I think was shock.  As I turned to my right s.l.o.w.l.y.. with all my hair standing straight-up, we heard the next sound~~~>  a chuuu..chuuu..chuuu..chuuuuuuu... (my feeble attempt to describe the sound of that huge branch I mentioned earlier that was shaking due to something GIGANTIC jumping off it into the water.  The splash that came next was equally as horrific.  All we did was just sit there in shock...waiting (I don't know why), staring at this point - straight ahead at the water.  My guess is that we were waiting for the thing to float into our headlights. We waited and waited and waited and all of a sudden an object - black - long - I would guess at least 9-10 feet, floated into our headlights and stopped. Please keep in mind that this action was deliberate, because it was floating downstream.  We stared at it forever it seemed.until it opened it's eyes - two huge balls of red (reflecting off the headlights of our car I imagine) light and looked at us.  My girlfriend's father at this point put the car into reverse, and we sped off.. extremely terrified. 1982--My second encounter (April): My girfriend and I were driving back from our senior prom (Georgia - chattahoochee river border area).  Our high school was 37 miles down-river \"way-out\" in the boon docks.   Anyway, as we were driving back home, we came to a flat 2-mile section of road that had a \"slippery-when-wet\" sign. Because we were tired, \"sober\", with road-hypnosis, the sign reflection caught our attention (she told me after).   As we came closer to the sign, something moved or reflected as we came closer - getting our attention. About 100 feet away, with our car lights fully shining on the it, we saw this massive, black creature leaning on the sign.  The top of the sign I guessed to be about 10 feet.  Whatever this creature was, all we could see was the top of the chest and down (about 10' of the creature!) we couldn't see the head.  It just stood there - we could see the massive muscles - most in rippling detail, shiny-black fur, standing with intelligence if you can understand that term, etc.  We sped-up all the while screaming at each other - scared to death.  A mile down the road, my left-rear tire blew out.  I drove 7 miles to the first house with a light and called my father to come out and help us.  While at this home, we talked with a few of the people that were there (they were having a party).  We were told a couple of stories about a missing hunter, animals found gutted or with their head missing.  A lot of strange screams in the night, etc.  First, I must say beyond a shadow of any doubt that this was no hoax - the costume alone would have cost thousands and thousands of dollars to create.  Second, the people that live in the area are extremely poor.  As a matter of fact, the home that we drove-up to after our tire blew, had light seeping through the cracks in the siding of the house, while it sat on cinder blocks - very poor people!", "location_details": "1981--Bank of the Chattahoochee River 1982--Highway 431N.

I did not know it would be this long to submit them, but I have since married, had a child, lived in three different locations, had five different jobs among other things since I last submitted that Limestone, Alabama sighting. This sighting/encounter below involved myself, and two freinds, it unexpectdly and without intent being my second. The event I relate here happened to me and two friends in April of 1994 while I was attending Troy State University, Troy. I was undertaking graduate studies at the time. I lived in a campus dorm and had become friends with several people in the dorm and about campus. One of these friends stayed in a room a few doors down. He dated a young woman that stayed in the International House across campus. I had been studying on that paticular night I write of and had become bored with it. My friend knocked on the door and came in. I for the most part had an \"open door policy\". The door may be open, but knock before you enter so I'll know you are there. As Kevin and I talked we agreed to go pick up his girlfriend, Donna and go to \"Lookout Mountain\".  I had been out to the place once before during the day about a month earlier so I offered to drive. We left campus around 11 pm or so. We headed up Hyw. 231 north. About 8 miles from the Campus we turned west/northwest (left) onto Co. Rd. 17   As we got closer to the so-called Lookout Mountian we noticed fewer and fewer houses. After about 15 minutes of driving we had found it and proceeded to park just off the road. We got out of my vehicle and then walked up to the top of this large hill. The hill is about 100 feet high from what I remember. It is supposedly the highest point in Pike County. The place seemed to be a well known and well used spot with open areas about the path to the top, besides one could see for several miles to the west, south and east from atop this hill. I recall seeing the rotating beacon that night at the Troy Airport several miles to the south. I knew we were not the first people to walk to the top and hang out nor were we going to be the last. Everything seemed cool. After about 15 to 20 minutes we three decided to head downhill toward the car and find something else to get into. I think we had decided we were going to go to Subway for a late night snack. Now here is where it got weird. Just after we started downhill I began getting a funny feeling and the hairs started to rise on the back of my neck, like something was there and we were being watched. Seeing how we were out at night in the country plus having a lady with us, Kevin and I had decided not to be foolish. We had both brought along weapons. I had a Colt .38 stuffed in the back of my pants in its holster and a few extra rounds in my pocket plus a good sharp replica Samurai sword. (Yes, a sword). My friend had a Glock 9mm and an extra magazine of rounds. My friend was in the National Guard at the time. I pulled out the .38 before we got even midway downhill. I had looked over to where Kevin and Donna were to my right. He had already taken out his 9mm so I knew he also sensed something by then as well. It was also about this time that we started hearing rather heavy footsteps. As we moved along I notcied the steps were on both sides of us. By the time we had arrived midway downhill we were aware that there were five maybe six...somebodys or somethings out not far from us. I recall that there were two and I'm pretty sure a third distinct grouping of footfalls to my left and two off to my right. Kevin was closest to the ones on my right so I'm sure he had heard them much better. Also by this time our Donna had become almost hysterical. I'm sure her few screams did not help matters much. Kevin said that it might be some other people messing with us like Frat boys. We stopped breifly. He shouted a few warnings that whomever was there had better leave us alone or speak up, he was ready to open fire. No answers. Nothing. I remained quiet, listening. Now any person in their right mind (perhaps even in a drunken state of mind) would have said something in order to keep from being shot at, I would think, yet there were no answers, no response of any sort. Just slience. We then continued to move downhill toward my vehicle but whatever they were kept back a bit and out of our sight and also to our sides yet they kept moving down along with us, not trying to hide their footfalls. As we approached the bottom of the hill we ran for it,  got into the my car as fast as we could,  cranked it up quickly,  backed up, and took off back the way we had came. I am not sure if whatever they were moved out into the dirt road behind us or not as we drove off. I looked back but, it was really too dark to tell. Aside from that the road was narrow and had trees along each side of it and I was being as careful as I possibly could so as not to run off this road. I don't recommend under such cirmstances trying to drive out of such a place and look back at the same time. It took several minutes after we got back onto Hwy. 231 for Donna to calm down. I was shaken up but not too bad. I suppose the driving had something to do with it. I'm not sure how Kevin felt. I assume that his military training had taken over for a time back on that hill. We never saw what they were. Except for the footsteps they were otherwise quiet. At first I was not sure what they may have been however after considering the strange activites I felt they could very well have been bigfoots. I still feel that is what they were though I can never be 100% sure. Even so, what they did while we were on Lookout Mountain would seem much like reported and researched bigfoot behavior.  After a few months and leaving Grad school I eventually lost contact with those two friends. I've not been back to Lookout Mountain since even though I have traveled up and down that part of 231 near there many times. I'm sure with a little driving about those dirt roads off Co. Rd. 17 I can find that hill again. I'm just not too sure I'd want to find it once again at night.

I woke up to use the bathroom at about 4:00AM and had just laid back down when I began to hear loud vocalizations. The sounds where very similar to the Ohio and Mississippi recordings. I was inside the house and his heating unit was running so they must have been very loud outside. I got up and went out on his back deck but by the time I got there they had stopped. I listened for about 10 minutes and heard nothing. The heating unit was next to the deck and was quite loud so I decided to go back inside.

The feces were the consistancy of horse droppings in that they were of high fiber content and contained undigested muscadines(a kind of wild grape). But the droppings weren't in the shape of horse manure,(round ballshaped piles) but were long and cylindrical like that of a dog or human. The  feces(2) were about 18-24 inches long and about 2 1/2-3 inches across. Rather large I must say.    The tracks then turned left again into an area of tall grass, small pines and other small trees that lined a field at the edge of the woods. I wasn't able to follow them very far due to dead branchs, briars and undergrowth that blocked my progress. Plus I was wearing only sandals, shorts, and a tank top. Not prepared to trek through the woods. I took pictures of the  tracks and the feces with a yardstick for size comparison. I also took a specimen of the feces and turtle egg shells which are still in my freezer. I have a cast of a left and right foot. The right one broke trying to pick it up but is still n pretty good shape. The left one is completely intact.  They measure approx 18 inches long, 8 inches wide at the toes and 4 1/2 inches at the heels. The stride measured 3 feet from the toe of one foot to the heel of the next step. Each foot has 5 toes. A humanlike large toe on the inside of the step and each toe following being smaller than the last. There is an arch to both, showing it is not flatfooted. I took these samples to the Univesity of Alabama and showed them to a professor who is an anthropology professor in forensics. I walked away disappointed to hear him insist that what I had were Bear tracks. But he had been on a bear trip since I had spoken to him a few days prior about my find. When I arrived at his office, before he even looked at the cast he was talking bears and showing me books and pictures of bears and bear tracks.  I tried to say Bears don't have a Big toe, but he tried to make up reasons that these tracks of a \"bear\" had a big toe.  I realized this person was not going to believe what he was looking at was not a bear. It either frightened him to think it was a possible Bigfoot out there or he was embarassed to say he didn't know what it was. Just a \"Bear\".  Well there is our encounter of a Track sighting.

We got there just before dark and had been there for several hours when it happened. The place where we were is on a large power transmission line right of way.There is a small stream that crosses the clearing, and a very steep hill on the side where we parked. In fact, so steep that it is difficult to drive a four wheel drive down to the stream. On the other side of the stream there is a low level spot that then becomes another steep hill. I would say that the hills are a good 50 feet higher than the stream. I had parked my truck on the hilltop, and we sat on the tailgate facing the stream. Around 11:00 pm we heard a very loud snorting noise coming from the bottom of the hill, and the sound of brush moving and breaking. I thought that it was a wild hog, because they are plentiful in this area, so I told my wife to get in the truck, because I was afraid it would attack us. She got in the truck while I tried to find my flashlight and my gun. When she slammed the door, I heard a loud, low growl/grunt and it sounded like something large started running up the hill towards us. I was standing in the bed of my truck by now trying to shine my light down the hill, but the batteries were weak and I couldn't see very far.There was a very bright moon out so I turned off my light, and could see a large shadow moving around about halfway up the hill towards us. I was listening to it move around and make the same growl/grunt noise. I could also hear what sounded like breathing noises. I then caught scent of a strange, musky, sour odor and heard more brush breaking and what sounded like stomping noises. I was certain by now that this was not a wild hog, but couldn't figure out what it might be. So I told my wife to start my truck and rev the engine a few times and when she did, I heard what sounded like something crashing through the brush heading down hill and moving fast. We were both a little spooked by now so we left. As I pulled out onto the dirt road off the power line trail, I turned toward the bridge that crosses the small stream (the road roughly parallels the power line) a large number of deer ran at high speed across the road,heading away from the stream.

Franklin County Alabama Pine Forest/Hardwood Forest/Open field Between 4:00 and 5:00pm.

I was roughly 75ft from the fence when this occurred.  My jack russell dog saw them and took aften them. He often follows me hunting as this place is next to my house.  After chasing them for about 10 mins he comes back towards me when he suddenly stops, looks towards the pine thicket, lets out a weird yelp and takes off towards the house visibly something wrong.  I stood there and heard a noise and the deer that had ran by came back by as if something had spooked them again.  As they came back up the hill I heard what appeared to be a large animal coming from the thicket.  I thought it was another deer that had separated from the herd and was coming back to join up.  As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket.  It came down the fence line and went over the fence in the direction of the deer.  I could clearly see that it was on two feet and did not pay me any attention.  I watched it for less than a minute before it disappeared down the hill from me.

As military firefighters we would often be assigned to small airfields (stagefields) around Ft Rucker. At the time this happened I was assigned to Tabernacle stagefield. Tabernacle was on the north west end of a large impact area used for aerial gunnery by pilots in training. During a typical duty day we would have several down time periods where aircraft were not flying. These down time periods would typically take place around noon and evening lasting 2.5 to 3 hours. When I was assigned to Ft Rucker, I had met some other Soldiers that introduced me to Indian \u201crelic\u201d hunting. This consisted mostly of lots of walking through tilled fields, creek washouts, and recently cleared timber tracts looking for arrowheads and anything else related to the old Indian tribes that formally lived in the south east Alabama region. I had found that the down times when aircraft were not flying often granted me the chance to get out in the woods to hunt for arrowheads. Often I was able to get several miles away from the stage field during the down times and was usually by myself for several hours. My typical hiking outfit was to put on a pair of cargo shorts, an old pair of army boots, a belt with a canteen, a pouch (for any finds), a large survival knife, ball cap and a walking stick. I usually would not wear a shirt hoping to get a tan while out walking. This day in particular was in I left my stage field around 1100 AM or so. I headed East, North East for about 1.5 miles on an improved asphalt road that bordered the impact area. I then head north down a dirt road (path was more like it) that was seldom traveled. The road went up and down some gentle hills and was bordered on both sides by heavy vegetation and thick woods. I believe I had walked maybe \u00be of a mile when I was approaching a small creek crossing which was not unusual. I was maybe within 50 feet of the creek when off to my left side I heard a lot of movement approximately 150-200 feet into the woods appearing to come from the creek bank. I heard what I can only describe as a grunt and my first though was a wild pig. That thought was quickly erased though, as I immediately got instant chills\u2026goosebumps running my entire body\u2026and had the heavy feeling that I was not alone. I heard another grunt and peered into the woods from where the sound came from and saw a large \u201cshadow\u201d\u2026easily 6 to 7 foot tall stand from the creek bed. Because of the thick woods I got no clear view of it but my first thought was that it was a large very dirty man but it definitely had the appearance of a man shape. I only saw this thing for a few seconds as it appeared to see me\u2026and me watching it and it turned and went crashing into the woods away from me. I wasted no time turning my walk into a trot away from what I had just seen. Whatever it was it scared me and as I headed back to my airfield I tried to make sense of it. The only thing I could conceive it being was that maybe it might have been a stray horse back in the woods. I know this sounds very unlikely but I really didn\u2019t want to believe I might have seen something I could not explain\u2026a horse in the woods I could almost believe. I never went back into that area of the woods again, and seldom ventured into thick woods period after that. I never gave it much thought after that as I had chalked it up as being a horse, which seemed to make sense to me. I did bring my strange experience up a couple of times to some folks but they thought I was kidding them and none of them had ever heard of anything like that in Alabama before. Two things led me to revise my thinking of what I saw that day. The first being this. In 2000\u2026I was and am still living in Kansas and serving in the Army Reserve. We had a new Soldier join my unit. He was a former Ranger Sniper team leader having been assigned to the Ranger battalion at Ft Lewis, WA. He was a good old country boy from Kansas living in a small town. He and I became very good friends and later served in Iraq together. We would often talk about events in our lives at length. During one conversation I related my story about what I saw in the woods assuming he would think I was nuts. But\u2026he believed me. As a matter of fact he said if I saw something I found hard to believe he said that I should just go with what my gut told me. He then informed me about his experiences. He told me about his time up at Ft Lewis and as a sniper he would often be in the woods alone for days at a time in hide sites during training missions. He told me that at night in the deep woods he would often feel as if he was being watched and would hear the sounds of something large moving through the woods. Now this fellow was an experienced woodsman and was used to the sounds and smells of the woods. On occasion he was able to see something quite large in the shape of a man moving around his hide site through his night vision goggle. He said it would never come too close\u2026just kind of checking him out. He said he never felt threatened by it and on the occasion it would make some sounds (grunts or whistles) as if it was agitated and he would talk calmly too it. He said that he wood talk in a slow, low voice telling it \u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you, just calm down, I don\u2019t mean no trouble for you\u201d. He said that usually after he spoke towards it, it would just move away from him and would leave him alone. He said this happened numerous times as he was often in the same area. He told me he had no doubts at all that \u201cBigfoot\u201d was around but he would never do anything to harm it and he felt that if left alone it would not harm anyone. So that got me to thinking, maybe that afternoon in the woods I really did see a Bigfoot. The second reason I feel that I didn\u2019t see what I convinced myself was a horse is that after culling the BFRO website I found that I am not the only one to have seen something in Alabama. So\u2026I am not alone and I am now convinced that what I saw was real\u2026and not something else. I haven\u2019t shared this story with very many people\u2026but maybe this is the time to do it.", "location_details": "I have looked at some satellite images of the area and cannot pinpoint the exact spot just the area within a few hundred yards.

I heard sirens in the distance. the local rescue squad was responding to an incident. curious about what was going on I decide to go and see. when we arrived, I found out that 2 bham men had went canoeing and had not been seen since. the sherrif wanted to call for a helo to search the river. I piped up and told them that in was not a good idea. the trees cause a tunnel affect over the river. the helo wouldn't be able to see under the growth. on top of that the sun was starting to go down. he agreed and sent 6 men in 2 canoes down the river. 30-45 minutes passed and we were told that they had been found at a local bar in b'ham. my friend and I volunteered to pull the rescuers out of the river at a mid point near the road. we set off. the light was almost gone. as we made our way down the trail to a place where the stream and the cahaba meet my friend took off ahead of me. he knew the area better and i could see his light moving ahead of me. as I entered the bottoms where a bamboo thicket grew, I heard brush breaking and grunting noises to my left. I quickley made my way across the stream. I felt much better and safer once I crossed the stream. as I rejoined my friend at the intersection of the stream and river, I told him about what I had heard. he said it was probably a boar rooting for acorns. we sat for about an hour waiting. the moon was out quarter waxing, and hot as hell 100% humidity 90 degrees. after waiting I said to my friend that we must have missed the rescue team in the night. so he went to find out and he left me there on the bank to make sure they were not just slow getting down the river. another 30 minutes went by and I started seeing a light up the bank approaching my position. I pulled myself up into the foliage to camo myself, just in case the light was moon shiners or pot growers. they are notorius for bibb county. minutes passed and I heard my name being called. I made my way back across the stream and through the thicket. the grunting and brush snapping sounds still happening. as I climbed up the hill to the large over hanging rock i paused to catch my breath holding onto the tree. all of the sudden something large much taller than myself( I am 6'8\"tall) rushed me. more of the limbs breaking and a vocalization sound like an excited baboon and a fierce growl.

Instead of being rewarded with owls responding to my calls I heard a scream or moan about three quarters of a mile away like I had never heard before. I asked my friend what in the hell was that? He replied that it was probably what some of the old farmhands referred to over the years as the hairy man, which some of them had told of seeing from time to time for many years. I hooted once again and the same scream replied only closer this time. We stood there a little longer and could hear something big coming up the hill through the woods very quickly. By the time we got into the truck we were treated to another hair curling scream still in the woods but getting close to the hayfield. We cranked the truck and drove as fast as we could thru the bumpy field. When we arrived at the gate my friend asked me to get out and close the gate so that nobody could trespass onto the property. The gate was a quarter to a half a mile away from where we were run out of the field. As I opened the truck door to get out I was treated to yet another scream from the hay field. The gate did not get closed that night. What this was I do not know. I know that there was no livestock kept in this part of the farm.

I drove to an oil well location that is located south of town off the main highway and parked my truck there. I left the location and walked down an old road and headed east into the woods to hunt along the ridge and wooded area that joins the swamp.  I'd walk the road and then leave it and wade through the bushes looking for squirrels then head back to the road and follow it for a ways and then leave the road again.  I'd been hunting for a good while and had gotten to an area where the briars and bushes had taken over the old road.  I decided to turn around and hunt back toward the truck since it was getting late, and I hadn't seen but one squirrel and that was soon after I got into the woods. Just as I started to head back, I got a whiff of the most foul odor that I have ever smelled.  It actually made me gag, because I have a very weak stomach.  I figured it was a dead animal or a wild hog, but I'd never smelled any hog that stunk that bad. I knew I couldn't stay there with that smell, so I turned to head back down the road.  As I did, I heard something make a couple of growling type sounds in a clump of bushes off to my left, and saw the bushes just shaking like hell.  I still figured it was a hog, but I'd never heard one that sounded like that and figured if it was a hog it would grunt instead of growl.  I was getting nervous about meeting up with a big boar, or maybe even a big cat, so I took off at a fast pace back up the road.  After I'd gone a ways, I heard what sounded like three squealing hoot type sounds, still to the left of the road.  I was very spooked by then thinking that can't be a hog, and picked up my pace even more.  After a ways, I stopped to listen and when I did, I heard something out to my left take a couple of steps and stop. It sounded like someone walking out in the bushes, and it didn't sound like it was too far away from the road and I could swear I heard heavy breathing.  I headed for the truck again wanting to break into the clearing before it got completely dark.  Just as I got within sight of the well location, I heard the walking sound again and looked behind me thinking I'd see a person following me on the road.  What I saw was a tall reddish looking creature cross the road behind me about 20 yards.  It was moving in a hurry and I only saw it for a second or two.  It stepped completely across the road in one step, then it sounded like it was running away from the road through the bushes.  I took off for the truck at a full run and when I reached the truck, I jumped in and got out of there in a hurry.  I don't know what it was that I saw, but I'm sure that it was at least a foot taller than my 5'8\" and it looked massive, like a giant hairy man with long arms and long hair all over it's body, and the fastest moving thing I've ever seen or heard. I've been back to the area since then with my nephew, but the timber has been cut in that area and it's no good for hunting anymore.

So on the way back from the store I knew to slow down in those areas just in case. In one area it is a rather sharp curve and I had seen the most deer there. As I came up on the curve I slowed down and suddenly something jumped out in front of the car!!! I'll call it a \"he from here out.\"  He seem to have been running from the pine tree line and took a, what I would call a leap, out onto the road then he was gone. It was only 1 maybe two steps on the road it's self to clear it! I had slammed on the brakes and just sit there in awe wondering if I really seen what I had.  He was standing on two legs, lots of fur and what I would assume Is at least 8 foot tall. When he jumped in front of the car he was about a car length in front of me. He looked to have had a large fish in his hand. I know how that sounds but I swear it was a long fish. My husband said it may have been a stick but I'm a country girl and I know my fish! His \"fur\" was longer than what bear fur would be and although he was dark brown it had a reddish hue to it, the headlights gave s good look at the color as it leaped across.  There is a lake back behind where he was running from but he also jumped across to the right where those 6 plus deer were standing. We are going back at first light to see if he left foot prints. It's so muddy I'm hoping to see some.  We hear sounds out here almost nightly of what we describe as big foot sounds but I've honestly never thought they was out here. It is just sounds you can't describe, so we call it bigfoot sounds. I've had several friends and family hear them and one of them will not stay outside long out here because she's heard it so much. When I got home my husband came to the door to help bring stuff in and ask what was wrong, I said the deer are out bad and he asked if I hit one, I said no and he asked why was I shaking. I didn't realize my whole body was still shaking! LoL  I started telling him and I had tears rolling down, heart pounding and still shaking so bad. It really shook me up so much.

There was a owl that would hoot every night. Louder than any owl I have ever heard in my life. We used to joke that it must be as big as a man.  It was also slightly off sounding. Also, it called like this all year long. Not seasonally. 2. Our kids became afraid to sleep in their rooms. They said someone was watching them. They never saw anything, but said they just felt weird. So they slept in our room with us. One night around 2 a.m. we were all woken up by a pounding on our house. Pounding so hard on the other side of the house that our bedroom windows were rattling. My husband yelled and it didn't let up at all. Just a rythmic pounding. Our gun case was in the room closest to the banging. My husband jerked that door open, grabbed his gun and ran outside with a flashlight. There was nothing there. He ran around the house and still didn't see anything. The next day we walked around the house looking for prints of some sort and there were no visible prints. The grass was very thick and lush at the time. Our nearest neighbors were over a mile away. This was about June 2002. 3. We had a momma goat that gave birth to twins. We found her and one baby dead by a pond about a mile from the house. Not much left of either except the hides. We thought it was coyotes or maybe a mountain lion, but even then it seemed unlikely. More like they were carried there. No drag marks anywhere. 4. Our new neighbors and their children came over for dinner. My husband and our neighbor went to check Gates and cattle in a pickup. The kids were playing outside in the yard and the wife and I were talking in the living room with the door open so we could hear the kids. About 45 min before sunset her 13 year old son came up to the house and told us he was scared. His mom asked why and he said he heard something weird in the woods. He was starting to tear up while he was telling us but his mom said oh stop that, go play. And he did. I yelled at the kids and told them to come closer to the house and stood with the door open listening. I thought I heard something off in the distance, but I thought maybe it was a bull and sounded odd because we lived down in a narrow valley. I stayed in the doorway watching the kids and chatting and heard the sound again and told the kids to come on in, because it was kind of creeping me out. I was feeling on alert but still wasn't exactly worried. My husband is a prankster and I thought he was trying to scare me.  By now it's right at sunset and the woods about 100 yards from the house are too dark to see into. I heard the call again and I have never before or again heard a sound like that. By now the kids are freaked out, crying and telling me to come inside, my heart is pounding and I'm thinking- that's not my husband.... The sound started low and slowly went high, I have no idea how long it went on but the thing that made that sound had to have MASSIVE lungs. It wasn't a monotone sound. Almost like there were two sets of vocal cords sounding at the same time. A couple of very low sounds, almost like I could feel them in my chest more than I could hear them, and then it yelled again.  It sounded like the call came from the other side of the creek about 150 yards from the house, directly in front. I was more stunned than scared at this point, but my eyes were watering and I did feel strangely sad suddenly, and I had backed all the way up to the door. Right then the guys came back, from the opposite direction of the calls. We told them what we heard and they listened but heard nothing, grabbed some flashlights and ran down to the creek and followed the creek about a quarter mile but didn't see anything. I didnt hear it again after that but our kids never played outside close to dark after that either. After that we had some stuff moved around or missing. A couple of dogs disappeared and one night it sounded like rythmic tapping on the water pipes in the house in the middle of the night. My husband even crawled under the house to find out what was going on but saw nothing. The next day we saw the pin was pulled on the latch for the well house (by the creek) and the door was standing open. Just odd things like that.

It was August, but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors. I had been in the area maybe two hours but as I like to wander around slowly (I see more that way) rather than \"hike\" from point A to point B at a quick pace, I had not covered much ground in that time.  I was at the edge of an aspen grove when I heard a loud howling from up slope and a little to the east of me in the direction of the ski resort.  My first thought was that it was a foreign tourist goofing off. Because Snowbowl has a paved road to it and the views are awesome, tourists from all over the world on their way to the Grand Canyon stop at Snowbowl and many hike around as it is a beautiful and inviting area.  So I thought I was hearing a human.  But I wasn't so sure after the next howl- I was really puzzled.  The sound seemed somewhat human-like and the volume, though  quite loud, wasn't too extraordinary- I could possibly howl that loud, though it would be hard to do without real strain and the sounds I heard were almost casual- no hint of any strain.  But it seemed to be an unusually weird sound for a human to make.  Almost as if the human had a deformation of some kind which distorted the sound.  This was why I thought of a \"foreign\" tourist first, because of the weirdness of the sound. I heard about a half dozen calls and it was clear that whatever was making the sounds was coming in my general direction at a rapid pace.  By this time, I was sure it was not a human but a large animal. I was at the edge of a clearing and I waited at that spot expecting to see whatever was making the calls.  The first howl was maybe 250 meters away and the final one maybe 75-100 meters away.  Then it stopped and I never did see anything.  I did not hear it moving through the woods and did not notice any smells.  It is possible that whatever it was smelled me as the air was gently moving up slope towards the animal.  I think it probable that this was the reason whatever it was stopped moving towards me and vocalizing. I waited a minute or so after the final vocalization and then I went up slope in the general direction I had last heard it but did not see anything or any indication of a human or animal.  My curiosity was at a peak and so I made a real effort to find whatever it was and spent another hour circling the area looking for signs of a large animal passing through. I have listened to the recordings on this site and I did not make a match between the sounds- though there were some similarities between what I heard and the calls from Washington State and the 'Ohio Howls'.  What I heard was not nearly as drawn out and evenly toned as the Ohio recording, but was similar.  A deep to mid-range 'howl' with a little variation in the tone somewhat similar to the Snohomish recording.  Each call lasted maybe 3-4 seconds and was seperated by various lengths of time from maybe 5 seconds to maybe 15 seconds.  Some of the recordings on this site, if I heard in the field, I might describe as having a 'monkey' quality to them- distinctly animal-like.  The Ohio recording does not really have that quality and neither did the sounds that I heard.  At the time I only thought of a human at first and then I was merely puzzled and could not classify what I had heard. I have thought about this incident since it occurred trying to put some explanation to it.  I do not think it was a human for a couple of reasons:  The sound, though it had a somewhat human-like quality, was not at all the type of sound a human would (or perhaps, could) make to communicate to another- say two or more people in the woods who are separated and walking along and vocally maintaining contact with one another. The volume of the sound would have required real effort for a human to achieve and I couldn't imagine a human being able to howl like that and walk around a mountain at that elevation at the same time- and it was traveling fast.  Nor did it have any element of humor about it if it was just some high spirited tourist having fun.  And there was only one caller, not two or more people hootin and hollering to each other.  The call was somewhat somber in tone and there was no hint of excitement or emotion about it.  Also, a human walking through those woods would have made a great deal of noise and I would have heard or seen a human when I went looking after the last vocalization.  I did not see any humans during that day though I went right to the base of the ski resort and could see the parking lot. At the time, the sounds did not spook me and I never got that unexplained adrenaline rush and surge of fear that I have gotten on more than one occasion in the wilderness or ocean.  I am quite familiar with the wildlife in this area and have heard and seen just about everything except a mountain lion. It certainly was not an elk, bobcat, coyote, dog, or cougar.  It might just possibly have been a bear-  I have had several close encounters with bears and have heard their vocalizations.  But bears do not, to my knowledge, vocalize in such a regular, loud way.  Because I heard 6 or 7 howls, I had time to really hear the sound and think about it.  To me it sounded most like an ape, though I only thought of this much later. What I heard was not much of an incident. I puzzled over it for a long time.  I am reporting it here because a sasquatch is the best possible answer that I can come up with, though I did not come to that conclusion until months after the incident.  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings.  Another puzzling thing though- if it was a sasquatch, that area is quite popular with people and when I go there, I usually do see someone else.  That area could be easily avoided by an animal.  Despite the abundance of wildlife as a potential food source, why would a sasquatch travel through this area at midday in the summer , howling?

Our destination was Granite Lake, two miles from the outlet of Upper Blue Lake.  We reached our destination, had lunch and were returning, following the trail back the way we had come.  When we reached a pond, about 1/3rd of the way back, I expressed a desire to my wife to take a hike southward across the same elevation level as the pond, to another lake called Evergreen Lake. There is no trail or pathway to this lake, and I thought it would take about 20 minutes to reach it.  My wife declined to accompany me, so I told her I would return in a while.  I began walking, trying to keep my position along the same contour line as the pond.  The forest was fairly dense, and generally well covered with pine needle duff, generally underlayed with decomposed granite.  After a short walk, I realized that very likely few people had ever gone where I was headed, as there were no signs of previous travel, and the going was sometimes difficult.  I tried to stay on the contour, but kept slipping lower down I went.  After a while - more than 20 minutes, I realized that I wasn't going to find the lake, so I started back.  As I walked back I took a different route, trying to regain the elevation I had lost on the trip out.  I came across a section of forest floor where there was mostly decomposed granite, and as I followed this - which was a bit easier to travel on - I come across two sets of footprints.  The first set looked almost human, except they were wider and longer than usual.  Noticeable were the toes, and a definite arch.  The second set of prints were from a larger creature, and left a deeper impression, especially in the heal area.  This track was wider still than the first, and looked similar to typical casts of Bigfoot prints. There was no noticeable arch, and the toes were not especially evident. Both set of tracks were superimposed at points, indicating that one creature was directly following the other, stepping in the same spots at times.  The tracks quickly were lost in the pine needles further ahead. It had snowed two days before, and the ground was damp, but most of the snow had melted.

During the time I was cooking, I set up a camp fire, but didn't light it yet. After we finished eating, I started the campfire. After the fire was burning for about 15 minutes, I kicked it into the fire pit from the grate. At that time my wife got a very strong feeling that we were being watched from behind our camper. She said it seemed to move (the feeling) from behind the trailer, from one end to the other. There were trees, and dense foliage behind the trailer. I started to look around with a flash light to see what it was, and after not finding anything, I started the car and plugged in the 12v spot light.

We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \"skunky\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time. Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \"hoots\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \"There.\" I said, \"Did you hear it that time?\" \"No.\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \"hoots\". \"What do you think that is?\" he asked. I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond. As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \"whacking\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \"hooting\" and \"whacking\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area. The \"whacking\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \"What do you think that is?\" I gave the guarded response: \"I'll tell you what, I've spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I've never heard anything like this.\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \"Bigfoot\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive. Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \"whacking\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \"whacks\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \"whack\" from our South/Southwest. I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \"whistles\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \"whacking\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \"crack\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \"whacking\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings. In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \"amphitheater\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \"skunky\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk. At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger's Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully. We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\" in width) to a point about 6\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression. That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual.

We had hiked down Kanna Creek Trail to look for game. We had spent most of the day on stand and hiking.  We made our way back to my truck. We decided to stay the night so we could hunt in the AM and then go home. We were getting things set up for camp. Building a fire getting food out to cook. I had a Pop-up camper and I had just got it up and situated when my friend said \"What the heck is that sound!?\". He had never spent much time in the woods as I had so he was freeked out instantly. I came out of the camper to see what the problem was.  Then I heard it. It is the hardest thing to explain how it sounds but, here it goes. It sounded like a scream. Deep in sound, very loud and it lasted for long periods of time with the sound going up and down in volume.  It also sounded angry for some reason. At first I didn't give it much thought. I had heard a Mountain Lion screem and that will make hair stand up on the back of your neck. I have also head bears. But bears do not do that sort of thing.  They are quiet most of the time. As this sound is going on and on and on pausing for short moments as if to catch its breath, my friend is realy freeked out by now. I said to him it is just a Lion or two lions or a lion and a bear fighting across the lake. This did not calm him down much. I had my sidearm on me still. So I pulled it out and shot off a round in the air during the screeming.  Silence.  See I told him, we scared it away. I started to go about getting food out so we could eat. Now it is a little darker and you can't quite see details across the lake but you can still see. not even a minute later after firing a round off in the air, the sreeming started again. This time closer but still across the lake, louder and it seemed more pissed off! As if it was very mad we were here. Now we could here like bush being raked or shook but we could not see it. Just hear it. Now, I am getting freeked out because of what just happened. It came closer! Now, you would think a gun shot would scare game away not bring them closer. My friend is now really freeked out and wants to leave. NOW! I tell him \"We have highpowered rifles and we will be safe\". The whole time we are talking about leaving, the screeming is going on. I gave in to him wanting to leave and started to pack up camp. This took some time for us to do. Maybe 5 minutes or so. During this time the screeming was going on the whole time. Got everything loaded in a hurry buttoned up the camper and we got in and started it up and left. It is now dark and headlights the only lights besides the stars. The drive up and out of the lake has a few switch backs. I stopped at one to see if the screeming was still going on. It was not. We then drove out of there and down the mountain not saying a word. We had stopped to get a bite to eat and we just felt unsure of what we had experienced. Both of us decided not to say anything to anyone. I know I didn't say anything to anyone about it for a long time. I am unsure if my friend has said anything to any one. I have watched shows on TV about BIGFOOT since.

The trees in this area are dense, so I couldn't see anything moving. But I could clearly hear loud footsteps crunching through the underbrush, about 100 to 150 feet away. I was not particularly worried, because the animal was rapidly moving in the opposite direction I was headed. After about 10 or 20 seconds, the animal made a loud, deep, resonant bark, like a combined dog bark and foghorn. The crunching footsteps continued moving away, when after 20 or 30 seconds, the animal made another loud bark, exactly like the first. I didn't hear anything else. I never saw anything.

I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when, after laying a box down at the curb, I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren, a loud and ascending WHOOOOO\u2026, coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didn\u2019t change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction, but rather from the highway behind our house, I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming \u2013OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with, I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP, an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area, as if it had been startled.  The owl\u2019s voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried, as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds, but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox, and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs, owls, and whippoorwills. As I stood there, logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away. Over the next few days, I told my family members what I had heard and asked if they knew of an animal or bird that made such a sound, but they didn\u2019t.  The sound I heard was so unusual, that I couldn\u2019t dismiss it.  I felt the need to keep trying to satisfy the mystery of the sound by placing a native bird or animal to it.  I read every voice description of Florida bird species entries in my North American bird book, paying closed attention to all owls, loons, cranes, egrets, herons and hawks, that I thought may be large enough to have such a bellowing voice.  None of the voices were described as \u201cwhoops.\u201d  I then went online and searched for \u201cbird sound whoop\u201d and \u201canimal sound whoop.\u201d  I spent quite a bit of time on National Geographic\u2019s website listening to voice recordings of numerous birds from this area as well as bobcats, coyotes, foxes, etc.  Nothing seemed to match.  I then started to notice the many links to the BFRO website as well as a link to a video of our local Channel 13 newscast of an expedition that BFRO had in the Tampa area about a year ago.  When I played the news clip, and heard one of the female researchers make a call out like a whoop, I almost felt relieved, like I knew in my heart that I was on the right track.  The sound I heard was very similar to the call she made, although the whoop I heard was of a longer duration.  After seeing the news clip, I felt more comfortable about researching the information on the BRFO website.  I came across the sound recordings, and after listening to several, I became convinced that what I heard matched more closely to some of the Skunk Ape recordings than to any other animal or bird known in this area.  I decided to call your organization to discuss what I had experienced. Below are the most similar recordings I found on the website as compared to the sound that I heard: 1974 Whoops and Knocks from California (although I heard only one \u201cwhoop\u201d and it was of longer duration) The \u201cFlorida Howl\u201d and the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County, Ohio (the howls in this clip start off like the siren-like beginning of the whoop I heard, but these then descend in pitch as opposed to the one I heard which continued to ascend until ending in a \u2013OOP)", "location_details": "Exact location omitted", "county": "Seminole County", "state": "Florida", "season": "Summer", "title": "Report 24134: Homeowner hears possible howls east of Winter Springs", "latitude": 28.63434, "longitude": -81.14076, "date": "2008-06-30", "number": 24134.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "djn6csep57", "temperature_high": 92.12, "temperature_mid": 81.66, "temperature_low": 71.2, "dew_point": 71.15, "humidity": 0.78, "cloud_cover": 0.43, "moon_phase": 0.91, "precip_intensity": 0.0071, "precip_probability": 0.52, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1018.97, "summary": "Rain in the evening.", "uv_index": 10.0, "visibility": 9.78, "wind_bearing": 225.0, "wind_speed": 1.32, "location": "POINT(-81.14076 28.63434)"}, {"observed": "Me and my father were hunting at richloam wildlife management area. we had been walking through the swamps all morning and on various occasions there was a really fowl smell that would come and go.

My dad was only going about 10 to 15 MPH and as we went by we got a good view of what it was or at least what it looked like, as he hit the brakes I could not belive what I saw.

I'm not about to say that what I saw was a skunk-ape, but I can say that (since my experience) I absolutely believe that animals (even large ones) can co-exist around us without our knowledge of their presence. Here's my story .... I was with my family on a summer camping trip at Johnathan Dickinson State Park (just north of Jupiter, Fl). There was an observation tower (about 30 ft high) along the same road that leads to the campground. About 5:30 or 6:00 pm I jogged from the campground to the tower alone (it was probably 2 to 3 miles). When I got there, the fence around the tower was locked. Since this was an un-manned tower setback from a road that had very little traffic (in-fact the entire time I was gone from camp, there were no cars), I decided I would hop the fence. I'm not one for blatantly breaking rules, so I was very careful not to make too much noise climbing the fence. When I got to the top of the tower, there was a built-in wood bench that wrapped along the perimeter of the deck (about 12'X 12'). I spent about 5-10 minutes looking in all directions (but there wasn't much to see). The skys were clear and there was about 45 minutes to an hour of sunlight left. There was a clearing of low-lying brush (about 3-4 ft high) that extended out from the tower for about 30-50 yds. in all directions. At that point it became pretty densely wooded. It was peaceful up there and I was tired so I rested for about 20-30 minutes by laying down on the bench. When I got up, I noticed the sunlight was beginning to fade so I figured I'd better get moving. I remember being upset with myself for staying so long because I would not make it back to camp until nightfall and I didn't want my parents to worry. When I got to the base of the tower, I climbed the 8' high fence at a point that was perpendicular to the road. Once on the other side, I could walk the 100' or so along the fenceline to the road. Unfortunately, I slipped at the top of the fence so I instinctively pushed off the fence and dropped to the ground on the other side. When I came down, I landed in a bush which made a lot of noise (I had been deliberately very quiet up til that moment. The position of my body was slouched over and facing away from the fence towards the woods beyond the low brush. It seemed as soon as I hit the ground, making all that noise, something popped its head up from under the brush (about 25 yds. away) and I saw it immediately because I just happened to be looking in that direction. I saw just its head at first and we just stared at each other for a few seconds. At first, I was not sure whether I was looking at an animal's head or a person's head. I remember it was rounded at the bottom and more elongated towards the top. It seemed a little bigger than mine and was covered with short silvery-gray hair. Its face seemed human with a flat nose, its eyes were small and dark. It made no sound. After a few seconds of silent starring, it turned towards the road and began moving quickly. It seemed to be running on all fours at first; but after about 10 yds. it stood up on just two legs and continued to scamper until it crossed the road and then disappeared into the woods. I would guess that it was about 6-7' tall. It's frame was very large from the hips up and it was covered with shaggy silvery-gray hair. After it was out of sight, I stood there for a moment trying to rationalize what I had seen. I saw it clear enough to know what it wasn't. It wasn't a man - it was definitely an animal. It wasn't a bear, deer or panther. Not even close. Surprise had turned to confusion and was now becoming fear. I didn't want to hang around (defenseless) against an animal larger, stronger and faster than myself. I ran back to camp, checking behind me as I ran. By the way it had reacted, I assumed it was probably as scared of me as I was of it. When I reached camp, I tried to tell my family, but they just laughed it off and said it was probably a dog or a homeless man. Of course, I knew this was not the case, so I became upset. Not wanting to continue the conversation, my father became stern and so I dropped the subject. The next day we went home and I've never been back. Until recently, I've pretty much kept this story to myself over the past 24 yrs. When I found your site (and some others)on the internet and read of other encounters it motivated me to share my experience. I sent info about my experience to a web-site dedicated to finding \"skunk-apes\", but I really found much of their material to be uncredible. I wanted to share my experience on this site because I feel your opinions and observations are genuine, thoughtful and reserved. P.S. I remember watching the local news one night (around 1977) about a supposed skunk-ape sighting by not less than 14 people during an air-boat ride thru the everglades. They interviewed the driver and a couple of riders who stated seeing a large hair-covered animal walking upright near the edge of an island in the swamp. I thought having so many witnesses would have made this a more credible and compelling sighting. Although I have read of many sightings in Florida which matched the stories my neighbors told me when I was younger, I have never seen or read anything (on the internet) about the airboat sighting. Have you or any of your readers ever heard of this sighting. Perhaps it was proven later to be a hoax or a mis-identification.", "location_details": "The entrance to the park is off US 1.

It was still good light out, just before we entered the woods my nephew decides to go across the other woods to see the other side of the field while I wait for him. I was out in the open, I was away from the tree line about 60 yards. I noticed a movement from the distance when I look it was walking big steps right where we had hiked, from what it seemed like it was following us in the distance. I was really scared, I started shouting for my nephew. But wouldn't get my eye off of it. It stood behind a tree moving its head gently side too side looking at me. I was gonna point at it with my rifle too see it through my scope but I didn't because at the same time I thought what if its a ranger on a ghille suit? I didn't want to point at him with my rifle.

Drum and Okeechobee, Florida on Jan. 18, 2004. It was almost dusk, approx. 5:30 PM. There was only one other car on the road and it was several miles away in the west bound lane coming at me ( two lane road). I took this opprotunity to remove my sun glasses. A spring type clip on which I need both hands to remove. I turned my head and dropped them in my purse on the seat next to me. As I looked up toward my rear view mirror a flash of movement caught my attention. It happened so fast all I saw was the last few steps of a small hominid running across the road in front of me. It wasn't close but I'm not sure how far away. It stopped on the edge of the road for a split second and made a leap over the roadside ditch and a barbed wire fence. I tired to reason I had seen a limpkin or a sandhill crane but knew it wasn't. I braked as soon as I saw the first movement and slowed to 20 mph by the time I thought I was where it had leaped into the bushes. I couldn't see any bushes moving or water movement. I was so intent on looking at the side of the road I didn't think to look into the pasture on the other side of the barbed wire. If I had been sure in my mind I had seen a wading bird I wouldn't have slowed as I see them all the time. I knew in my heart it was something different from what I'd ever seen before. I have reported this to the Mysterious Encounters web site and have thought more on it and will now revise my estimates of it's size. I judge it to be 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall and between 75 and a 100 pounds. It had a very round head on an upright body no neck to speak of. The hair was long and silky not matted or tangled. It was a brownish red, more light brown than red. I'm sure it had it's head turned away from me and I was seeing the back of it's head as I didn't see any facial features. I remembered seeing it's foot later. It was like a person of color whose skin is darker than the sides of their feet. The hair hung lightly over the sides of the edges of it's foot. I saw one arm and it reached almost to the knee.  When it leaped it didn't swing it's arms out or bend it's knees to jump it just leaped flat footed, pushing off. The distance it leaped was approx. 20 to 25 feet. Seeing it bothered me and then I saw the Redwood Giant episode of Mysterious Encounters, Jan. 24, on OLN. A man on the show said a three foot tall hominid ran in front of his car in NC. It hit me like a shot, I knew what I had seen then. That's when I filled out the report form on their web site. I did a Google search tonight and found your site. The more I've thought about it and talked with my family ( after they stopped laughing) we have come up with other times we could have been in the presence of these hominds over the years. Once two years ago my son and I were on the Kissimmee River, the western boundry between Okeechobee County and Highlands County, Florida. We heard a call...scream.. yell, from a distance. After discussing it my son said it must have been a big bellied redneck out hunting or a skunk ape, we laughed it off but kept a watch around us the rest of the day. It was very disturbing. A year a go a friend and I were on the board walk of the Grassy Waters Preserve on North Lake Blvd in northern Palm Beach County, Fl. It was early morning and we were walking to the end to go into the little nature museum and looked out across the water and sawgrass toward a cypress head. Standing in plain sight was a BIG dark figure. It would bend over and do something in the water at the base of a cypress tree, then stand up and act like it was eating something. This went on for quite a while, bend over- stand up. The woman who was in charge of the museum came out with a pair of binoculars but they were so badly fogged we couldn't make out details. Just a big homind figure. There are many more times and incidents I could relate but they go back to the mid 1970's. So I will stick with the present.", "location_details": "The hominid ran across hwy 441, the location was maybe a 1/3 the distance between Ft. Drum and Okeechobee.

Subsequently, my wife and I often drive around on the weekends to get better familiar with our new home town. Today, (Saturday Sept 2, 2006) we struck off to go to a shopping mall called Waterford Lakes and it was en route to the mall that I saw something peculiar. My wife was driving today, so I was relaxing looking out the passenger side window at the various swampy patches that are so common in central Florida and I must confess that I'm always looking for wildlife. My wife teases me because she knows that I'm primarily looking for aligators and thinks that it is such a \"tourist thing\" to be doing. However, on a couple of occassions I've actually spotted aligators sunning themselves, as well as numerous deer and turkey, so I feel justifed enough to keep looking. Well, we were traveling south on the Florida Turnpike and just saw a sign for the Ocoee exit when off to my right I saw a man walking in a very swampy & rugged section of meadow about a hundred yards to the right of the turnpike. As he was going in the same direction as we were heading, I was able to watch him for about 5 to 10 seconds and really didn't think too much about him other than he was pretty gutsy to walk in that area all by himself, considering that he seemed to walk with an odd gait. Another strange thing was that he seemed to be dressed in all brown from the head down to his knees (the tall grass covered his lower legs, so I can't say if this guy was wearing shoes or socks). Please note, this took place at about noon, on a very clear Florida day and I believe that the temp was about 93 degrees, so seeing a guy walking around such an area without a hat, or short sleeved shirt is unusual. Well, by this time we passed the fellow and I kept looking off to the right to see where he might ultimately be headed, but for the next few miles all I saw was more swamp and grass. As I stated, my wife was driving and didn't see the man, but I was talking with her about it as it happened and she asked me a few questions (she thought he was probably homeless). When I started describing the man to her, I started to question whether or not the \"fellow\" I saw was necessarily human.  For example, either his hair was very, very bushy, or this guy didn't have much of a neck.  Actually, his head looked a little pointed. He must have been fairly big, because I could clearly see him even at 100 yards distance, yet try as I might, I couldn't identify a single article of clothing on him. Finally, I couldn't even confirm his skin color, because I literally only saw dark brown over his entire body, including his hands. I must confess, I'd be thrilled to think I might have seen a bigfoot, but I just don't know because my first thought was that this is just some poor idiot who was going to pass out from the heat in the wilderness.  But on reflection, I think could be wrong. One thing I can say for sure is that he didn't seem frightening or monsterous in anyway.  I would imagine a bigfoot encounter to be much more exciting than this.  However, I was at a very safe distance and in a moving auto, so I might feel differently if I met him on foot.  Any thoughts?

He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on, all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat.

I drive a long time, the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance, I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator, and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking,  and he disappears into the woods. So I am pulling over now, snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it's not cleaned up, and if someone hits that, there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a \"man\" be out here at (now) 7am exactly, walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh, and a DEER sign. A sign, just a moment back I passed , warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he's tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where's his truck? Where's his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful, warm, dry, summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He's not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don't think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot. So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn't want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn't. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed, goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on. Putting this all together in the months since the event, it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon. It has been almost a year, and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand, and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a \"hey--maybe that's a \"somethin'  \" at a moment's notice.  Meanwhile, since my incident I have heard of two other sightings in locations that are within 2 hours driving distance (east or south) of my incident.  I continue to search for new reports of local sightings and hope to make future trips to search for tracks.

It was early morning before 8AM. We were told we had to rent a canoe and couldn't go out by ourselves, had to go one a guided trip. I grew up in the area and had covered on foot, horse, swamp buggy, canoe, etc. But they ranger still wouldn't let us go. So we walked the boardwalk and I looked out to the cypress heads and squatting down at the base of a cypress tree was a dark figure. It would dig a little in the mud at the base of the tree and stand up and put a hand to it's mouth. I asked a Ranger for binoculars and she came out to look. The humidity was so high the binoculars fogged over and were useless. We watched the figure squat down and repeat, dig around, stand up and it did it over and over. Another Ranger came and my friend and I watched this motion for about five to seven minutes more then left. I have no idea how long the rangers watched it or if they saw it leave. If it turned out to be a bear that would thrill me too. No bears had been seen in Palm Beach County since 1979. But I'm sure it wasn't a bear. It stood too straight and bent at the waist and squatted at the knees like a human. A Bear doesn't bend the waist. I had forgotten about it until after I had a sighting in Okeechobee Co. I filed a report on the Okeechobee sighting and spoke with and went out to the area with an investigator. I've decided to report the first sighting because of the way Fish and Wildlife handled a sighting here in Columbia County, Fl where I now live. Big joke, lots of laughs. I take offense to that attitude. I've spent a life time in the swamps and woodlands of Florida, put in 12 years as a wildlife rehabilitator in Palm Beach County. It's pretty safe to say I know what I'm looking at. My friend and I talked about the sighting in 2006 and she said if that's what I thought we saw she was happy with it because she didn't know what it was either. I should mention she is a Veterinarian nurse, pretty familiar with animals too. Since the second sighting I've been putting a lot of research into the subject and would like to discuss ideas with other people but haven't found anyone to carry on a serious conversation with. Since the Finding Bigfoot program came on air and as more information comes out I hope to get past the jokers.

We were driving along a road that we have been many times. It's a nice little stretch of road with a great view. The land is beautiful with lots of natural Florida woods with swamp areas. There are also many orange groves in this area. It's not uncommon to see turkeys, hogs and occasional deer. The pasture land has cows on it from time to time.

I began to walk into the woods at approximately 6:00am. The area I chose to hunt is a section of woods bordering the river. As I was walking, I heard a low, guttural vocalization that sounded almost like a native american dialect, only in a much lower range than most people would speak in. It reminded me of the Samurai chatter that I have heard on your website and others. I heard the sounds for about 10 to 15 seconds, and then once again a few minutes later. On Wednesday, 11/25/09, my oldest daughter and I returned to the area to hunt squirrel. We hiked back into the woods for about a mile, and found a log to sit on amidst several promising looking trees with squirrel nests. On the way into the area, we walked a game trail and smelled that \"wet deer\" smell that you often encounter around white tails. Almost immediately upon arriving, my daughter asked if I heard what she did. I asked her what it sounded like, and she said it sounded like someone walking through the woods. I told her I did hear it, did she think it was a deer, or wild hog, or some other animal. She said \"no daddy, it sounds like a man walking\". I had noticed myself that the steps sounded bipedal. Upon leaving the area, I decided to take the opportunity to show her various signs of wildlife in the area. The game trail goes throught the middle of a small meadow. The meadow contained tracks from deer, wild hog, turkey, armidillo, racoon, etc.. There are many fallen logs in the area from hurricane Ivan a few years ago, and they have become prime locations for grubs to inhabit. This is probably why so many different types of animals are making use of the meadow. One track in particular caught our attention. It was the bare footprint of what appeared to be a large man, toe prints included. My size 13 boot is 16 inches in length, and this print was approximately an inch longer than my bootprint. The print was made in a soft mound around an ant bed. I placed my boot print in the mound as closely as I could. The surrounding ground was too hard for tracks to show. My daughter immediately assumed that it was a bigfoot track. There are stories of \"swamp boogers\" in this area, so it really did not surprise us. I took a photo with my cell phone, which as soon as I can figure out how to download to the computer, I will  be glad to provide. I put a 3\" shotgun shell in the print crossways to show the size.

I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn't a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further.

I was called away to work and was unable to continue with the call. With that said, I would like to finish sharing my experience. I was working as a fence contractor in central FL during the 80s. We had obtained a job to build 10 feed plots for deer in a remote area off of hwy. 44 near the Blackwater Creek area of the Wekiva River Basin. The acreage is vast and was utilized for big game hunting. Since there was a deadline, we had all of the fence material trucked in and we set up camp at the end of the access road. This allowed us to be onsite until all work was complete. On the second day of our stay, we (myself and a helper) were surveying and clearing a fence line in the early morning hours, it was still misty with little light coming through the trees. There was four of us total working, so we split up into two teams to knock out the 10 plots. While my helper and I were clearing brush we were commenting and joking about an odd odor (skunky/sulfer like) we had been smelling a few minutes before reaching the site of the first plot. As we were pulling a string line, abruptly, a dark, bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us. At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us, but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human. It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair, un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide, pointy and large) with a very short neck. Once it stepped out, it seen us as well, and when we shouted out the names of the other workers it quickly vanished into the treeline. We viewed the creature for what seemed to be 60 seconds or so before it bolted off. My helper and I were stunned at what we had seen. We spent a few minutes trying to rationalize it but there was no doubt we witnessed something extraordinary. I was carrying a side arm so we walked up to the clearing but could not see anything through the trees, however we did hear something moving rapidly away from us for a few seconds. That was the first of two encounters. The second encounter happened on the fourth night of our stay. All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek, about 15 feet from the waters edge. That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank. We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior, with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such. There was a cooler that we had tied to a rope and placed in the creek to keep the contents cool. As we were eating a loud splash from across the creek startled everyone. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone, as well as the rope and stick it was tied to. We all walked down to the creek bank but there was no sounds other than the normal water movement. The missing cooler was chalked up to raccoons or an alligator. As we settled back into eating, one of the guys walked away to relieve himself, as he returned to the truck everyone looked at him, he was silent and all the color was gone from his face, he just looked at me and said \"I'm sorry, I will never doubt anything you tell me again, ever\". Not sure what he meant at the time, I asked him what happened, he quietly turned and pointed, saying \"someone or something was standing on the other side of the creek watching me pee\". It was obvious he was actually scared speechless. I grabbed a spotlight and we all walked down to the spot where he was standing. As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements, eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could. As soon as I turned the light back on and the beam hit the other side of the creek, we heard a loud grunt, almost similar to a pig, I panned to our left and that's when it all happened. A large bipedal, hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes. It stood fully erect, the light shine of the eyes were almost gold, it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would, by throwing it's forearm up in front of its face, let out a chilling sound (not a grunt, more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard, it then turned and fled, vanishing like before. All of that happened in just seconds and all four of us witnessed it. We immediately packed up our gear, went to a motel and stayed at the motel until the job was finished. Three of us later went to the FL fish and wildlife office and reported what we had seen. It was during that report when I first heard the term \"skunk ape\" or even that there had been other sightings of this type. I can honestly tell you, without any doubt, it was not mistaken identity. I grew up as a hunter and outdoorsman and I know what bears look like and also how they act in the wild, it was not a bear, it was definately a primate of some type.

Accessing the yard would be hard for a bear now. Our dogs did not bark but, we had been setting off fireworks, so, I kind of let them off the hook! This occurred again about a month later in August. I had stepped out on the back porch to get a soda from the refrigerator. I felt the hair on my neck stand up and about that time, I heard the same low growling noise straight in front of me that we had heard in July.

I saw nothing, and there was no noise of something running away. The woods are thick there so, someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear.

It was around 1980 or 1981. My brother, I and a friend were hiking in an old cow pasture that was very overgrown. Back around 1980, Davie still had lots of woods and overgrown orange groves. Sure, I had heard of the skunk ape, but was never concerned. Being a boy, I was adventurous. Anyways, we were in the pasture hiking when we found an old tractor trailer. The trailers doors were missing, the were off and lying rotten on the ground, (with trees growing in them). We noticed that the trailer smelled real bad. We decided to climb in and look around. All we found was stench, like an animal lived in there. We were too far from the road for a bum to wander in and there wasn't any sign that anyone \"kept the place up\". We lost interest in the trailer and started to hike some more. We came upon a canal that forked with another one. To make a long story shorter, I saw something looking at us from across the canal. We were still about fifty yards from the edge of the canal at this point. Whatever it was didn't take notice of us right away, but as we got closer it looked up and raised its \"arms\" above its head as if it was waving at us. This area was very overgrown and all of my previous trips, I had not seen anyone out there. Whatever this was scared us all so bad, we ran all the way home, locked the doors and didn't return to the area until a few years later! My brother, now, says that we were imagining it. I have thought that it was a snake bird (you know, the ones that sit on a post and spread their wings to dry). However, I keep replaying the incident in my mind and I don't see a snake bird.

I first encountered \"something\" in the spring of 1994 when camping with a group of friends in the woods bordered by Lyons rd to the west, the Florida Turnpike to the east, Sample road to the south, and the Winston Park development to the north. I left the camp alone at about 1:00 am heading east, towards the Turnpike on a trail. I began to hear what seemed to be footsteps in the woods maybe 5 - 10 yards to my right. I'd also like to say that I smelled a musty odor, but I could be inserting that into the report - it's been awhile since I had the encounter, and my recollection isn't as clear as I wish it were. Regardless I continued to walk, and the footsteps were remaining parallel with mine, and it bacame clear that whatever was two my right was walking on two feet from the stepping pattern. I started to get a little frightened, because the area where the footsteps were coming from was a thicket of Brazilian peppers - difficult to walk through during the day, and nearly impossible to manage in the night. I heard it move closer, and I turned around, and walked briskly back to camp. I woke my friends, and we went back to find it, although it was gone at the time. I remember leaving with the impression that I had encountered a sasquatch (which must be because of the scent), although I wrote it off as a figment of my imagination - that it must've been a farmer or a vagrant in the woods. I preceeded to forget about the incident, and never mentioned it again. About six months later, my brother was in the same woods, maybe a half mile from where I had my \"encounter,\" walking at night with a friend. He turned a corner from one trail to another, and \"bigfoot\" was standing at the intersection of the two trails. He said that it had reached out for him, and he and his friend ran off. He told me about the experience, and I then related mine. We had a running joke for awhile that there was a \"monster in our backyard.\" I'd like to be able to have my brother provide his report, since he had a sighting and is a better and more credible witness than I am, but he passed away at the end of 95 (I believe I might be able to find the friend, however) Regardless, I wanted to report the incident for a few reasons - first - it's a very unusual area to encounter an creature like this - the area is surrounded on all sides by a significant amount of development. While there remained a good deal of open land, including a tomato farm, a tree farm, Tradewinds Park, and some undeveloped land, it didn't strike me as being an area where one would have thought to find a creature like this - there doesn't seem to be too terribly far for this thing to go without being spotted. Further, given the amount of development that has gone into the area since, its range is becoming severely limited. Still, the 1975 Broward report happened about a mile or two west of where my brother and I saw it, so it must have found a way to adapt. It's possible it could move along the turnpike and the sawgrass expressway somewhat unnoticed, making it over to the nearby landfill, as well as Quiet Waters Park, although it appears unlikely that it could've gone too much further without being caught in the middle of suburbia. Given the amount of development that has since gone into the area, it's range is further being restricted. It might be a very lucrative area to investigate. At the rate development is going, if it still back there, it's going to be encroached upon sometime soon.", "location_details": "Lyons halfway between Sample and Hillsboro, roughly where the Wiles rioad extension is being built.", "county": "Broward County", "state": "Florida", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 1831: Foot steps heard while walking on trail at night", "latitude": 26.28585, "longitude": -80.17845, "date": "1994-09-15", "number": 1831.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "dhwvx3py4t", "temperature_high": 87.11, "temperature_mid": 84.03999999999999, "temperature_low": 80.97, "dew_point": 75.82, "humidity": 0.83, "cloud_cover": 0.86, "moon_phase": 0.36, "precip_intensity": 0.01, "precip_probability": 1.0, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1017.59, "summary": "Rain in the morning.", "uv_index": 10.0, "visibility": 9.43, "wind_bearing": 113.0, "wind_speed": 9.63, "location": "POINT(-80.17845 26.28585)"}, {"observed": "My family moved to Charlotte County in 2000, bought a house in a quiet area and have been pleasantly surprised with the amount of wildlife in the area.  We had moved from Ft. Lauderdale and would frequently exercise, bike ride, walk, run or rollerblade.  It was January 2001 or 2002, sunny day, a cold front just went through the area.  It was mid-afternoon, about 65 degrees, wind was out of the North, North East.  I even remember what I was wearing.  My wife and I decided to go Rollerblading that day, and we had a basic route we skated.  As we made our way away from our house we got to one of our favorite roads, Koala, and proceeded down to the end at an easy pace.  About 2-3 blocks from the intersection of Koala and Collingswood we stopped and saw what I first thought was a very large dog, on all four legs, in the swale about 20 ft. from the intersection.  I looked at the animal and I thought I was looking at the profile of a dog, a really BIG dog.  Although I did not see a tail or a head I did not give it another thought.  I remember saying to my wife, \"We should have brought a lead to see if someone lost a dog.  I would hate to see it get hit\u201d.  As she was agreeing with me, we just started to move towards the animal and all of a sudden its head rose up and stared right at us.  The animal was not in the swale in a profile view on all fours, it was on all fours facing us.  It had a dark face which did not register with me.  The hair was long, reddish-brown.   As the animal looked up at us there was about a 2 second delay before it took off at an alarming pace.  RIGHT FOR US. Fight or flight sense kicked in. It started running, I looked at it as it gained speed and its hair was flowing in the breeze, there was no standard locomotive process.  It seemed to float.  The shoulders did not break a plane.  We turned around and started to get the heck out of there.  We feared that this animal was after us.  As I kept checking back at it, thinking I may have to confront it, I saw it move from the swale to the roadway effortlessly.  Again it appeared to float up the bank to the road.  Once in the road I could see the hair moving in the wind as it chased after us, I could see the front legs moving but the shoulders never broke a visual horizontal plane.  It took up a quarter of the roadway,  3-4 feet across, I would estimate 4-5 foot at the shoulder.  The animal drifted off into the woods to the north side in to an area that appeared to have been an opening made through the brush.   Maybe we were too close to its lair.  I don\u2019t know.  I do not know what it was, I thought perhaps at first it was a dog, then maybe an exotic large cat, or a bear but I ruled them out just due to the unbelievable speed, overall size (huge) and locomotive process this animal executed.

Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied \"Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied \" I thought it was just my eyes\". The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins.

I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable 'calls\" that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call.

Although a scenic trip during the day, at night its just a boring two lane road cutting through intracoastal type pine tree, dune-filled land. With no traffic heading south, I had my bright lights on and was just listening to the radio and staring straight ahead. My wife was sitting quietly, and, I actually thought she had fallen alsleep as it was approaching midnight. I had just rounded a curve and began on a straight-away north to northwest toward the entrance to Little Talbot Island State Park, which is on the right side of the road, when, in the distance about 150-200 yds ahead on me, I caught glimpse of a bipedal figure standing on the West side of the road just off the right-of-way, not moving. My very first thought was it was a park ranger closing gates and whatnot, but the second that I thought that, the figure began to walk East across the road (A1A), and driving 50 to 60 mph and closing fast on the creature, I began to slow down, all the while concentrating on just what I was seeing. The creature just walked right out in front of my car, never stopping, walking with purpose, swinging both arms, and I really don't recall the creature ever turning its head to look toward me. I would say that it was between 6.5 to 7.5 feet tall, muscular but rather skinny, long, shaggy hair about its entire body, with a tan to reddish brown appearance. As I approached closer and slowed even more, the creature was just about to step off the road and back onto the sandy, grassy right-of-way when my wife, who I thought was asleep, said \"What is that?!\".

I was on duty in an area know as Deerwood Park. Located in a quickly developing area that was once owned by Skinners Dairy. The area is still heavily wooded. Two weeks ago I was on duty in a building and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I was outside for 5 minutes. I heard a noise like something moving through the tree line. I turned my head toward the noise and the noise stopped. I called on of our vehicle patrols in the area and we moved to the tree line to investigate. We could hear the movement of something very large making very suttle movement. The officer with me and myself felt very uneasy. Laying on the ground 8-10 feet from the tree line was a branch from a pine tree. The needles on the branch were still green.There were no burn marks at the break to indicate lightning had struck. The branch was approximatly 3 inches in diameter and appears to have been broken and then ripped from the tree.What ever it was,sounded as though it moved away from us through the marsh land. This whole incident really creeped me out.On Fri/9-1-00 at about the same time 2:30A.M. The same patrol officer and myself were again standing outside the building I guard. We heard a sonic alarm coming from the building to the north of our location. The patrol officer I was talking to walked back to his car to drive over and investigate. The alarm stopped as though it reset or was deactivated. I informed the patrol officer that it was probably the cleaning crew. As we continued talking about what we were going to do in the gym that mourning. The officer I was talking to turned his head and his eyes got real big. He replyed.\" Look at that\". I turned around and looked toward the tree line and observed nothing. The patrol officer I was talking to sped off in his vehicle in the direction of the trees and I followed on foot. We searched the area and found nothing. The officer told me that he observed heavly built individual who's estimated height was between 7-8 feet in height. The individual appeared all black. The officer I was talking to said when he told me to look, the subject had crossed out of my line of site around another building 100 feet to the south of our location. This officer appeared to be very serious about what he saw. On Sun/9-3-00. I was talking to the other officer who works the same area.

When things are slow I take our electric golf cart thru the woods just to look around and maybe spot wildlife as I go. Between the college and the city pool which is west of the college are numerous ponds, wetlands, and pine tree flats on forestry land. There are also alot of training areas left over from the Navy days and a few old roads that are similiar to power line right aways running mostly north and south. Now to the day in question: We were allowing a contractor to drive thru our property to gain access to the forestry land and I went to talk to them to get an update on the project. It turned out they were not working that day so I was riding around just looking for wildlife. I came up to one of the old roads and when I looked north on the road there was something in the road sitting on it's hunches and it appeared to have one arm in the air and the other was scratching it's side. I was traveling kind of fast and could not stop until I was about 10 feet past the road. I put the cart in reverse to back up and it was not in the road any longer. I looked just past the spot where it was in the road and it was on the side of the road and was bending down a limb from a 4 or 5 foot pine tree peering out at me. This lasted for maybe 3 or 4 seconds and it ran in from what I could tell was an upright position. The small pines hindered my view when it was running but I am fairly positive it was running up right. What ever it was, was about 2 maybe 3 foot tall judging by the trees and was very black and resembled a primate. I worked at the Jax Zoo in maintenance for a few years and one of the exhibits I was responsible for was the Great Apes so I am very familiar with several different primates and it reminded me very much of a bonobo. I was fairly shaken up and I did not go look for tracks, signs, or anything. Now to present, a few weeks ago forestry had a timber company thinning the pines in the same area, I went back there to talk to the job foreman as they were using our property to gain access. They were two or three hundred yards back in the woods and I did not want to drive my cart back there because of the road.

I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.

They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.

At the time that I encountered this creature, I was 13. I will write it as it happeded. Me and my family lived in a rural community on the outskirts of Riverdale Ga. Behind our house there was many acres of woods. At that time that area belonged to  a man named Mr. Jackson. There was a huge lake there also, it was called Jackson's Lake. Mr. Jackson was a cattle farmer. His cattle were on the other side of the lake. There were many trails in those woods and me and my friend Daniel played in them many, many times. It was very easy to loose yourself out there all day. My encounter happened when I walked through these woods to a trailer park that was called Chatue Manner. The trailer park still exists today but is under a different name. I went to visit a friend. I started to notice that it was getting late, and my father had told me that he did not want me in those woods after dark.  This struck me and mother as strange, because we would always be in the woods. My mom would even go in those woods to pick blackberrys. At any rate I decided to obey my father - as I did not want to hear his mouth. I walked to the back of the trailer park and there you have to cross a big raveen. It is like 10-15 ft. down and then up again. I was covered in vegetation and that Georgia red clay. Down in the raveen was a creek, so you would get a little scuffed up. After I crossed that I went up a trail that went up hill by the lake and that curved around and led to my house. After passing the lake, and turing the curve I encountered my father. He said \"What are you doing out here?\" I said I was just coming back from Pam's house. He said \"Well hurry up and get home\". I left him standing there and started for home. I turned back to see what he was doing and he was walking toward the lake. I just kept walking toward my house - when on my right side I heard rustling in the foliage beside me. The foliage was mostly dense tall pine trees with all kinds of honey suckles and black berry vines and muscidine vines. That was the place where me and mom would come to pick blackberrys. I tured and looked and I saw this creature. This thing was massive. I could see him. He was only a few feet away from me. He stood parallel to me.  I was heading north to my house. He too was faced north. I was on a heavily walked clear trail, whereas he was in the shrubs. These little pine trees were taller than him. He was at least 7-8 feet tall. His arms were huge, like the size of thighs, they were very long. His chest was massive as well. This was no skinny creature. I looked at him. He looked at me, and off, off, off, I went running up the trail. I was so scared!!! When I started to run, he did too. He ran right beside me in the shrubs. I would look to my right and see him and the thing would make a loud sound.  It's like he would exhale and let out a very deep grunt/roar.  I kept running and he kept running beside me in the shrubs. This thing was completly hairy and it's face was dark but I could tell it was human-like because its head was like that of a human head but hair all over - but not on the face. When I had reached the part of the trail that forked off into an open field of tall grass/wheat like stuff, that is where he stopped. He would not come out of the shrubery. I looked back and seen him crouched there staring at me as I ran and he just was there in the shrubbery. When I made it home I ran in the house shaking like a leaf, and my mom was making supper. I told her what had happened and what I had seen. And she went to look out the dinning glass window. It was a sliding glass window and she said she did'nt see anything. She asked where my father was and I told her. Then she sat down with me at the dining room table and told me that was the reason that he did not want me in those woods. She said that he had told her that he had hemmed it up in a tree one night and that he just stood there in front of it and screamed at it and it would'nt come out of the tree. I never told anyone other than my mother and Daniel and now my 4 boys about that. But there was something in those woods and me and my father werent the only ones that knew it. One day I was watching TV after school (this was before any of this happened) and my father come in and told me to come and help him. I said why? Me and my father DO NOT get along very well. He said because Benji, our dog had got caught in a bear trap on the other side of the lake. I said \"WHAT?\" He said yes. So we went and tried to free benji and my father had took a macheti. He said he could not open the trap, so he was going to cut his foot off. I said NO!! So I pulled the trap w/ all my might and my father got benji out. Now why had someone set a Bear Trap in the woods? There are no bears in Georgia. The biggest animal besides that Thing I had seen were deer and cows. And the cows were on the other side of the lake, they could not come across one side because of trees and the other side because of a big steel fence. And other times before I had ever encountered this being, Me and my family would go walking in the woods and sometimes we would cross the steel gate over to Mr. Jackson's land and treck about a mile to a very sandy clear creek. That was the side where the cows were. On many different occasions we would come upon a cow laying on the ground dead with its whole stomach torn out. That was very weird to me, but because I was young and did'nt know much and since my parents did'nt say much I never put 2+2 together until my later 20's. There was something in those woods but it's probly long gone by now. There are houses all around that lake and Mr. Jackson no longer lives in his house. The creek where these things happened is called Camp Creek. The lake was called Jackson's Lake. It was private to him. Although me and Daniel would always play around the woods and the lake. The name of the street was and is Lyle Dr. The town Riverdale Ga. I will never forget when that creature chased me but when I got to that opening I knew that he didnt want to hurt me. Because I know by his massive size and that massive sound that he could have just ripped me apart had he wanted to. Needless to say that I did'nt go in the woods much after that.

We heard sticks breaking and rustling which I assumed were coons, as this is a good coon area. Then we noticed something larger coming toward the other side of the creek from a distance. Thinking that this is one of many deer that we often see, thought nothing of it until we caught sight of it in the back-light of the city or moon from the other side of the hill we were facing. This was a large bipedal animal, very unlikely to be a person, this time of night without a light (although we were fishing without a light source also). It came up to the top of the rock out cropping direct across from us and stood between two trees. It then squatted down and just sat there watching us. My son was scared, and I was intrigued. Within 10 minutes another came to join the first to his right and stayed just across a ravine. No more than 6 minutes later another came from the south, just to the left of the one squatting across from us. As this one got close, it let out a piercing shriek.

He had an encounter of something huge and making an un familiar noise he said he had never heard before. He is a 70 year old man and great guy. I recall laughing and making fun of him. Then the tables turned, I was in the woods alone hunting in the 2015 hunting season.I was in my stand and had several deer come in but they seemed very skidish. I drew my crossbow down on a nice buck and pulled the trigger. My arrow seemed to find its mark. I allowed about 45 minutes to go by and it began getting dark. As I climbed down out of my stand I began hearing some unusual noises. Kind of like I screaming growling noise. Now I'm soon to be 50 years old myself and as my father in law said to me. These were sounds that I had never heard before in the woods or anywhere else. I called my father in law and told him I had a deer down and asked if he could meet me out in the woods to help me get the deer out. He told me he was in Terre Haute Indiana, and that it would be close to an hour before he could even get home. I was too embarrassed to tell him I too was feeling pretty uneasy. I tried to keep him on the phone but he had to get off the phone.so I began tracking the deer I found really good blood. And was sure the deer didn't go far. As I started down a small hill I began hearing these noises again. It was as if I could feel these screaming growling noises in my body. I kept hearing what I thought may have been falling tree branches or something. I looked up on this hill side 30 yards from me and seen a sillhouette of something huge. I quickly headed out of the woods and continued hearing the noises all the way out. I called my father in law and told him about my encounter. He laughed and said you mad fun of me. We returned the next morning to find the blood trail  where I left off and we knew the deer had to be close due to the amount of blood. And then it was as if the deer just vanished.. We began working in circles to find nothing. There was a steep cliff to the east of where we found the last blood. We looked down torward the creek to find nothing. But the smell in the woods was as it was the night before. A very strong pungent odor. Kind of a cross of something dead and the urine of many different types of animals. I felt eyes on us the whole time we were out there. We went back several times without success. Then in April I went out to the same location mushroom hunting, I found that the woods was  very quiet. I didn't find any mushrooms so I headed out through the North end of the woods to look at deer sign. When it hit me, the smell it was so strong , I began hurrying to get out of the woods as I got to the edge of the woods to an area we call the  grassy area and there it was a foot print. A single foot print it was the left foot and was very large . The print was a good one very detailed you could see the toes and everything.I wear a size 13 and this print was way bigger than my foot.

I decided to go for a walk in the woods because I was bored and was thinking about shooting my rifle a bit. Nothing special, just what I normally did as a youth (since I'm not much of a people person I spent a lot of my youth in the woods). I was walking up a field road that passed thru a patch of woods that led to a larger feild on top of a hill a few hundred feet away. As I got halfway up the hill, I was suddenly shocked by a very loud whistle that was quickly followed by a scream that I had heard many times before as a kid. I knew from previous experience that I didn't want to hang around even though I was \"armed to the teeth\". I was 19 going on 20 at the time and I've spent the majority of my youth spending time alone in the woods, hunted almost everything in the area that could be legally hunted, so I know what the normal sounds of the woods are, and no, it wasn't a swine, bear , coon, or any other such creature. The scream I heard instantly filled me with fear even though I had an 8mm Hakim Mauser, 12 ga. shotgun, and a 22 cal. pistol. I always went hunting heavily armed because I have stumbled across sasquatch a few times before and decided that next time I'd be more prepared. I was about halfway up the hill when I heard the scream a few ridges over (1/2-3/4mi away from me). I quickly turned and decided to call it a night, as I was walking down the hill, I heard another scream at the top of the hill I was walking down (either they can run like hell or there were two). Before I got to the bottom of the hill, I then decided that although I had a lot of weapons and ammo, this wasn't anything that I wanted to shoot alone at night with only a maglite taped to my barrel. I figured running for the road would take too long and a more direct route would be better, so I cut across the field and jumped the creek behind my house. I guess I didn't notice till after I had crossed the creek, but it had followed me home (which wasn't far, maybe a few hundred yards). I can tell you that to keep up with a terrified 20yr old running faster than ever before, that thing had to be extremely fast. I stood by the back porch and could hear its heavy breathing and growling. It sounded kinda like a horse that had just run till it was winded, but the breathing wasn't labored. It was breathing in a normal rhythmic tone, not labored. I was terrified because even after firing a few rounds in it's direction I could still \"feel\" it's presence and hear it, so I unloaded in that direction. I fired over 100 shells thru the Hakim, a full box of shells from the 12ga. and every shell I had for my 22 before I ran in the house to grab more ammo and turn some more lights on. I must've shot around 150 or more shells, I figured that I had shot at it enough and wanted to save what ammo I had left in case it decided to try to come in for a visit durring the night, so I went in the house and stayed awake all night. The next day(about noon) I decided to go see what I hit. When I crossed the creek I could plainly see where I had fired because of the holes in the trees and the saplings that were broken from bullets. Found no blood, no footprints(it was dry) but I did find something I didnt expect...it had laid down when I began shooting and must've been there for a while because there was a flattened area that looked like a deer bed. Although deer do frequent the area, I sincerely doubt it was deer, because there was no scat, and deer scat alot in and around their beds, as well as it was a good 1/4 mi. from the nearest deer trail. I'm an experinced woodsman, and I have never run across a creature that was smart enough to lay down and stay put while bullets were flying over it's head...animals just don't have the reasoning it would take to exert that type of behavior. Like I said, I never saw it, I just heard it and heard it's foot falls, it was absolutely two legged, it was huge, and I don't think it wanted to say hello. Not sure what it wanted, but it was definately very intelligent.

At the time we lived in the 15 acre woods which is at that location. The Lake fork river runs just behind that woods and there is a bottom land just north of the woods which floods every fall. At the time I was a teenager and hunted, fished and trapped along a several mile stretch of that river. The encounters we had were not visual. The first instance was about 10pm on a winter evening when I was going to let our poodle out before turning in for the night. There was only what I could describe as a combination of a Scream/howl which came from just on the North side of the house. Our dog was so frightened it would not go out of the door. He was not afraid of anything and to see that fear in him was shocking. The volume of the howl was immense. My mother was home and heard it as well. Even from inside a well insulated Illinois home it sounded as if it was right next to you. I had the door open and it felt like I had been hit in the chest by the sound. The second instance was just south of that woods about a half mile down from where the river bends. I was returning from hunting about 5pm in the evening and heard the exact same howl. It came from the smaller wood which is right next to the river just south of our woods. The 3rd instance was a series of footprints along the bank of the lake fork river. Just to the west of the road intersection mentioned above, the lake fork passes under a bridge. Just south of that bridge the river bends and flows east. I was fishing along that bend on a spring day about 10 in the morning. I felt that there was something not right and then realized that there were no animal sounds. Typically there are all sorts of sparrows and red winged black birds, but there was nothing. I looked down as I was walking and noticed that I was walking next to a line of footprints in the mud. I wore mens size 12 hiking boots and these prints were 5 toed and 2\" wider and 3\" longer than my boots. They were very fresh with dirt still loose on the edge of the track. I looked up and down the river but did not see a thing. The river banks in that area are steep with tall grass. The forth instance was while deer hunting on the east side of the large woods just to the north east of that bridge. I had gone out bow hunting and had set up a blind on the east side of the woods. I had walked from our house and was set up in a blind in full camo by 45mins prior to sunrise. Just before light I heard the same howl which I estimated came from about 50 yards away to my north. It was so powerful that it shook me. I waited for several minutes and it howled again. Only having a bow and not a gun I literally walked backwards the few hundred yards back to the county road with an arrow knocked and ready to go. Not that it would have done any good. You could tell by the volume of the scream/howl that this was a very very large creature. The 5th instance was around 10:30 at night in the back of our house. We kept a large horse tank in the back where we would dump and burn trash. It was approximately 35 yards behind the house. I was taking the trash out and had just dumped it when I heard a \"Hmph\" from the edge of the tree line which was about 10 yards away. I head another \"Hmph\" and then something large taking off down the side of the hill towords the bottom land, I headed quickly in the house. The next morning I checked the area and could see the same size prints mentioned above. I couldn't see them clearly as before due to thick ground cover of leaves. The Howls around our house were heard by my mother. I do not know of any other people in the area having the same instances. at the time there were only 4 families living in that area.

As my friend and I were walking from his house along his 1/4 mile driveway that meandered through the woods along side of the creek we had heard some odd noises that caught our attention. At this point, we had been running through the woods for a few years together, felt extremely comfortable in them and knew many sounds and sign. Neither of us could identify these sounds. I do not recall the sounds exactly, but, it seemed to be some tapping noise, somewhat subtle and not alarming, yet it seemed clearly something out of the ordinary. So we decided to hop the old overgrown fence which paralleled the driveway, penetrate the overgrowth and go into the woods to investigate. Heading in the direction from which the sounds had been coming we soon noticed that some of the patches of grass that had managed to grow under the canopy of trees was matted down. The matting looked quite fresh as all the blades were still quite green and showing no signs of atrophy or recovery. While clearly other patches of grass nearby were exactly as one would expect, not matted down. We then spread out a little bit as we normally did when investigating the woods. Shortly after this I spotted a footprint, classic human shape with five toes, in some dried mud. Clear as day, there it was. Unlike the fresh appearance of the matted grass, this had been here awhile as the \"mud\" which had originally received the print was now thoroughly dry.  I called my friend over while I looked at it thinking, this doesn't make any sense, who else would be back here and why would they be barefooted? We again spread out and now I was head down and focused on finding more foot prints. Shortly thereafter, I heard a crash in the trees and my friend yelled, \"Run, run for your life!\" And maybe it was this comment that etched the memory of that day firmly onto the memory banks. I could tell in my close friends voice that he was dead serious. For that matter, he was never a BSer anyway. I lit out of there, running through the underbrush, past trees and hopped the old fence at a faster pace before or probably since. Reaching the relatively safety of the clearing the driveway offered and turned and yelled encouragements for my friend to get out of there. I could see him now, emerging from the underbrush, the expressions on his face said this was no joke. Just as I saw him begin to emerge and before he hopped the fence a large crash of breaking timber happened from directly behind him. Although overgrowth was relatively dense, I could see he wasn't causing the sounds of the smashing logs. Something had apparently broken a good sized tree or log directly behind him. There was no mistaking the sound of it, or the movement in the undergrowth behind him and to his right, but, what it was remained shrouded by the forest growth.  He made it across the fence and upon reaching where I was apprehensively standing, snapped back around and we stood shoulder to shoulder peering into the forest both uncertain of what exactly had just happened. I do know these to be certain:  Fact: Unidentified sounds were coming from the woods.  Fact: The grass had the appearance of being freshly matted  Fact: There was what looked to be a human footprint completely intact and showed the entire outline of a foot with five toes. It seemed only 10-12 inches long  Fact: Something or somebody was smashing up some decent sized logs and it wasn't us.  Fact: Somebody who doesn't scare easy was sure spooked that day.  Fact: An Illinois State Trooper came out that day to investigate our story. The trooper seemed to lose interest when my friend said that whatever he saw was about 7' tall.

It was October '04 between 9-9:30pm, heading south about 3/4 of the way to Springfield Il. after passing the interchange to go to Lincoln, not sure which county. There weren't many cars on the road. We were in the left lane, I was the passenger. At the very far edge of the high beams I saw what looked like one of those big black 50 gallon lawn bags sitting with a bunch of garbage right off the side of the road between where the pavement meets the grass. It looked like someone had dumped trash... I was wrong! Grant you this all took place in like 8-9 seconds. As we got closer I saw the garbage was fast food bags and the black garbage bag had arms and a head! When we were maybe 5-6 car lengths away it swung its arms out in front of it and shot straight up, taking a small step backwards. My friend and I both said 'what the hell is that?' As he slowed down a little. In the split seconds it was full on in the head lights standing I saw a medium build, not massive at all, but thick, hair was 4-6\" and flat black in color with just a little bluish silver reflection from the headlights and the face was a lighter shade than the hair like charcoal grey, I don't recall seeing breasts and the hair seemed thinner and shorter on its front. Facial features at that speed were impossible to make out, but its chin seemed to jut out from where the collar bone area would be on a human. My friend owned a Mitsubishi Montero at that time. It rode about as high as the smaller big pick up trucks do. I'm 6'4\" and I had to step up slightly to get into the seat, and as we passed it close up, in the windshield and out the drivers side window its waist was as high as the top of the hood, probably 4 1/2 feet, and the rest was at least that much. My friend asked me; \"Dude was that Bigfoot?!\" at the same second I yelled \"That was Bigfoot!.\" Funny I have read countless books on the subject from the time I was in grade school, and let me tell you...

Two months ago my wife and I purchased five acres of rural, wooded property here in Massac County, Illinois.  I mow approximately two acres of this ground, with the rest of it being heavily wooded. I know nothing about Botany, so I can\u2019t describe the vegetation on the property outside of an Oak and/or Silver Maple trees. Just take my word for it \u2013 it\u2019s thick with trees and underbrush. On May 3rd at 6:15p.m., my wife, myself, and my two boys sons went out to this new property to have a picnic at the cabin. I was half-way down the hill toward the cabin when my wife yelled, \u201cOh my gosh! Look at this - look at this!\u201d She was up the slope close to our parked trucks, staring at the ground. I walked back up to her position and she was staring at this print on the ground (pictures attached).  I had, evidently, walked right over the track without noticing. I then searched the radial area around the track and found two more partial impressions.  Growing more suspicious caused me to search the \u201cbottoms\u201d behind the cabin.  I found a strange tree structure and photographed that, as well. Listen, I\u2019ve got a BS in Management Communication and am pursuing a Masters in Theology. I am also a local minister, so my credibility is at stake. I would never consider fabricating a story, much less a story like this one. Now, we\u2019ve got to use a little critical thinking, but this is where logic and reality seem to be in opposition.  What makes a print like the one we\u2019ve found on our property?  There\u2019s two plausible possibilities; (1) A very large, very heavy man or woman \u2013 with a 14+ inch foot - is walking around out in the cool spring air with no shoes, trespassing on private property, out in a rural part of the country, risking arrest or a bullet. Or (2), ? I asked a good friend of mine, and member of the church, to take photos of the print using his 10 mega-pixal camera \u2013 the photos are truly incredible.

As we walked the road back we could hear something about 20-30 feet behind and off to the side of us moving through the brush and undergrowth.  Then at one point we had a rather nasty smell blow through the area, similar to a skunk or fox when they musk or spray.  At one point we know it crossed the road behind us and rather quickly because the noises changed which side of the road they were coming from.  At one point we were certain it was going to walk out into the open right in front of us but then all the sound stopped for a short period of time until we went down the next hill.  When we got ready to go around the last bend to where we had parked I took a look back and saw \"something\" squatting on a point next to a dead blackened tree which stood  around three to four feet tall.

Because the witnesses do not have Internet access, the information was entered with their permission. The first names of the witnesses have been changed. Tom: I told John about my sighting of the 2nd of June 2005 and he and his son went with me to the location. This was about a week after my first sighting. Right about 30 feet before the bend in the road I parked my car there and I was showing John where I saw the animal the first time. And we heard some commotion over in the woods and we were looking down into the trees. John was the first one to spot the silhouette and he asked me to come over, I guess my eyesight is a little better, and he said \"Hey, what does that look like to you?\" And then that was the time when we both saw its arm move and so I get on the hood of the car and I tried to get a better look 'cause I was going to see if it was either a shadow or three dimensional. I was trying to get looks of it from all angles without losing sight of the thing. It was standing motionless on the back side of a tree and you could see the majority of the body, he wasn't hiding behind a tree he was more leaning against it. That is when after we noticed the arm movement I'm on top of the hood of the car. Something caught my notice out of the corner of my eye to the right of the silhouette. Out in plain sight, plain as day there was an actual fur bodied, walking, probably 10 to 20 feet away from the silhouette I saw a smaller one and this one was starting to walk where the trees thin out it started to make its way to where the trees get thicker, and just walking. So at this time, I tell John, \"There's another one.\" And he says, \"Where, where?\" And I point in the general direction, I jump down off the car and run into the woods after it. It didn't run until I got about 20 feet in, that's when its pace picked up. It brought its elbows real high as it was running. And then I lost sight of it, because I didn't know that the ground actually sloped down. By time I got back to the hill I couldn't see it. Stan Courtney: Okay, when you started chasing the smaller one what had happened to the bigger one? Tom: I really couldn't tell you. I made a beeline straight for the one in front of me. John and his son were watching the big one. Stan: When you first saw the big one and you just saw a silhouette why did you think it was a bigfoot? Tom: At first I didn't know what to think. If anything it could be a man in a suit. When I saw the second one in the clearing as plain as day, I guess I don't know how to explain it but I just knew it wasn't a man at that time. Stan: What about the first animal? What did you see? John: When a truck came down the hill and around the bend the animal turned its head very slowly and smoothly and watched it pass by. Then it slowly turned its head back. Tom: I didn't see the head turn. Stan: What about the hand movement? Tom: Actually we saw the silhouette of the body, and as we were watching this thing the arm comes up as if to touch its face. And then we see the hand go back down. And I mean this was slow motion, it moved up as slow as it went down slow. Stan: How long did you watch it? Tom: From the time we saw the silhouette of the big one in the trees till the time I saw the little one was probably five minutes. I remember telling John \"We could stand here all day and this thing is going to wait longer than us.\" John: I kept looking at the first, larger animal. I concentrated on watching it.

It was very hot outside and we had been in a long drought. The nearest town is Makanda IL. The nearest road is Progress Lane which is off of Water V vcalley road. I believe it is near Union county. I had been told from a friend about some weird creature he had seen in the woods around this area. He claimed to have seen it once directly and heard it stalking him another time. He never said he thought it was a Bigfoot but I was still curious so I went out there to look around and see what he was talking about. He had told me that he had been out there many times and most of the time there was nothing strange. However, his girlfriend\u2019s grandfather had told him that there were weird creatures out in the woods. He described them to me as being 7 to 8 feet tall with glowing eyes and only moved at night for the most part. I have never seen any creatures out there but on one of my several trips out there in search of anything weird I could find I came upon a few trees with branches that had been snapped. I\u2019m 6\u20194 and 230lbs and tried hanging on limbs in similar trees and couldn\u2019t even come close to breaking them. I took pictures of one of the trees with my friend who is 5\u20193 standing next to the broken branches for reference. I thought that it was awfully strange that they were broken the way they were. It was as if something had broken them. We kept walking through the woods and about 10 yards past the trees with broken limbs; we found a poorly crafted hut. It was just big enough for me (being 6\u20194) to fit in. It was made out of very large logs and tree limbs. They were big enough that I couldn\u2019t move them at all. They were leaned together perfectly to create a shelter. While I was sitting in this shelter wondering how it could have been put together so well so far out in the woods I noticed a path leading out of it and into the woods. I followed the path and it led me to a place where water runs to when it rains to form a watering hole. I walked back to the shelter and took a picture of it. Sadly it isn\u2019t a great one but I know it is still standing and can walk to it. It began to get dark and so we headed back to the truck and left. It was months later I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where Matt and Bobo found something very similar to what I found only the one I found was much bigger. It occurred to me that my friend who told me about the weird creatures and personal experiences I have been told relates to the behavior of Bigfoots. While investigating more about this area and its history, I found a map of the area in which all this occurred and the area was very close to a lake that I fish often with a friend. On several of our fishing trips we would stay out late after dark and catfish. While we were fishing those nights we kept hearing very strange sounds coming out of the woods. They were strange enough that both of us were a bit nervous about them because out of all of our fishing trips we had never heard these sounds. Shortly after we talked about them and kind of brushed it off as \u201cthe woods\u201d we heard a giant splash in the water, as if a big rock was thrown at us. It was close enough to us that I jumped grabbed our spotlight and tried to see what happened. It sounded like it was within 30 or 40 feet of us but I couldn\u2019t see anything. I remember joking about it being Bigfoot trying to warn us away from his area then hearing more strange noises and another giant splash. It was a slightly windy night and very dark and with only one light I couldn\u2019t see where the splash came from or anything in the woods. Shortly after that we decided it was time to call it a night and left. This happened on at least 3 occasions in about a month\u2019s time. Every time the conditions were the same, it was a cool night slightly windy and very dark. The lake we were on was Little Grassy Lake. In the area of the lake we were on there are many lily pads and a large area of very shallow water. On those nights we thought we could hear something moving around in the water but it was far enough away that the spotlight couldn\u2019t reach it. We stopped fishing there because the water level dropped so low that there was no water to fish in or even to put a boat during the rest of the year. The incident at the lake took place in early April of 2012. It was during the summer of 2012, only a few months later, that I found the shelter and broken tree limbs. The way it looks to me is that a Bigfoot was in the area at the time of the fishing trips. There was plenty of water, food and shelter in an unpopulated rural area. When the summer came we experienced the longest drought in over 50 years. It would make sense to me that the Bigfoot would move to a different location because all the water in the area dried up. When I was out there was in September of 2012 I was taking my friends out there to show them the shelter and see if it was still there. While standing in a nearby graveyard I heard a large amount of chattering. I couldn\u2019t determine where it was coming from but it was like voices off in the distance. At first I thought I had to be people talking, but as I walked around trying to find them I realized I couldn\u2019t understand anything being said no matter how close the voices sounded. While watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot I heard them talk about Bigfoots chattering and how it sounded like people that you couldn\u2019t understand. I believe that there are Bigfoot that inhabit this area. I went out again March 1st, 2013 at about 11pm to try and do a night trip. I had never been out at night and wanted to try and see if I could find anything different than what I had already found.  We walked about a mile and a half out into the woods staying near a beaten path.  After we reached a certain point where the woods open up a bit we went off the path and started wandering.  We took a break and were standing quietly talking about where to go next or if we should stay.  It was lightly snowing and very cold so we weren\u2019t sure how much longer we wanted to stay being as it was already 2:30am.  While standing there I was talking to my friend who is a marine and another guy said \u201cis that a\u2026 moan?\u201d we stopped instantly and all 4 of us hear loud groaning or moaning sound.  Its hard to describe but it put all of us on edge as it stopped.  We decided to continue searching around a little longer and we walked down along the edge of the woods and I shined my light into the woods maybe 50 yards (not 100% sure on distance) away from where we were when we heard the moan only 5 minutes before.  When I shined my light into the woods I say what seemed to be a thumbtack on a tree, there are many thumbtacks on trees in  this area and I\u2019m not sure why.  As I watched to make sure it was a thumbtack a head turned and looked at me and I could clearly make out two eyes.  I stared at them and they stared back and I said \u201cguys\u2026 guys\u2026 I see eyes are you seeing this?\u201d  My friends ran back to me, I never took my eyes off of the eyes, my marine friend made it to me first and the eyes were still just staring at me.  As he started looking for them and more flashlights were turned on I watched as the head disappeared behind the tree it was standing next to. I have seen many eyes from deer having grown up in southern Illinois and these just didn\u2019t seem like deer eyes.  The way they were positioned on the head wasn\u2019t right.  They were closer together than deer eyes.  Usually deer will run when there are multiple people moving around them as closely as we were.  The eyes seemed to be about 40 feet away and it was like they sidestepped behind the tree, never looking away from me.  I\u2019m not sure if they can but I have never seen a deer sidestep.  The eyes seemed to be 5 to 6 feet off the ground.  I was also looking downhill at them.  I went into the woods within 45 seconds of them going behind the tree and never heard anything run away but we were unable to move through the woods quietly at all. When we reached the tree I believed they went behind there was nothing there and we could find no tracks in the half snow half dead leaf covered ground.  At this point it was nearly 3 and we decided to start making our way back.  What I believe happened is that a Bigfoot saw us up the hill and made a call which was the moaning sound we all heard.  I don\u2019t know that was I saw was a Bigfoot but I can\u2019t explain it saying it was for anything else either.  I find it hard to believe a deer would have acted the way what I saw did.  The eyes didn\u2019t seem like a deer but there are no other animals in this area that have eyes that big that could be that far off the ground.  The angle of the head wasn\u2019t right for it to be an animal like a raccoon on the tree.  It was as if something peaked out as we were walking by and I just happened to see it. The eyes stayed in sight for maybe 45 seconds and disappeared behind back behind the tree and the height of the head never changed. The next night I went out with almost the same group of people.  We got there at 1:30am and left at roughly 4am. It was much colder and not snowing.  We walked the same path we did the night before.  All the way to the spot where we heard the moan the night before it sounded like something was moving through the woods.  At first I didn\u2019t think anything of it but we walked for a solid mile and constantly heard something moving to our left. The two people in the back occasionally claimed to hear something on the right that sounded almost like a pig snorting or a horse sighing heavily.  I never heard these things but I was also at the front of the line and 15 feet in front of them.  I almost turned around and left several times because I had the strong feeling something was stalking us.  Constant twig snaps and I heard one woodknock all from the left side of the path. Like I said we walked at least a mile and I heard these things the entire way.  Once we reached the area where we had heard the moan the night before we heard nothing.  We stayed and walked around the area just as we did the night before and heard nothing and saw nothing and after the cold really started to get to us we decided to leave. It was not as interesting as the night before that but the sounds from the woods were very strange to say the least. I\u2019ve been in the woods, those woods, many times and haven\u2019t heard the twig snaps or a woodknock before and I\u2019d never had such a feeling of being followed/watched.", "location_details": "Its hard to explain how to get there unless you know the area.

Well guess what, I was just watching TV and they just ran a story about the same monster that I had encountered while I was going to Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois.  I was the bartender at the Midland Inn in Murphysboro, Illinois. This thing was in the wooded area behind where I was fishing. I kept hearing the brush breaking behind me but thought it was squirrels or deer or turkey. Then it started breaking whole trees, snapping them like they were twigs. I started getting very scared as the area I was fishing was miles from my truck or any roads. you had to trek in. Then a huge chunk of rock splashed into the water in front of me, then another. I turned around and it was standing there looking very pissed off that I was there. It immediately let out a scream. I can still imitate this scream. It starts out as a high pitched siren type scream that makes every hair on your body stand up. Then it gets higher pitched and is so loud you cant believe what is happening. With one step this thing could have reached out and twisted my head right off my shoulders. I knew I could not out run it so I just froze. I could not believe what was happening or what I was seeing. This thing was 5 feet wide at the shoulders. I was on the lower side of the hill so I could not get a real good estimate on height but I'm going to say it had to be at least 7 feet high. Nothing but pure muscular athletic bodybuilder outlined upper torso. A couple seconds after it screamed I was trying to think of an escape and turned away from it. It retreated back into the woods so fast that I lost sight of it against the wooded background almost immediately. I grabbed whatever gear I could and started running back down the trail as fast as I could. I don't know what I left there or what I took with me. I ran as far as I could until all I could do was a fast jog all the way back to the car. I was playing rugby for SIU at the time and was in pretty good physical shape. The whole time I was running I was thinking that it could have over took me at any time. There is more to this story. I had been fishing for bass with large shiner minnows for a couple hours. I was hearing something behind me in the brush. I kept fishing, something was stealing my bait off the hook time after time but I could never hook anything. A fat black water moccasin surfaced around the bank so I switched hooks to a #5 treble hook and snagged it. When I set it down on the bank and beat its head in with a stick, That's when all hell broke loose. To me it seemed that the creature was watching me the whole time I was fishing. After I killed the snake and wrapped it around a branch I pinned it to a tree. Right then is when the huge rocks hit the water, trees started snapping and I turned around to the scream. This is a true story. I fished this small lake several times before this happened but have never returned. My memory will never forget this spot on the lake, the snake, the scream, the creature. It has been over twenty years. Story has always been told the same. I told this story to a BFRO rep. about four years ago and I think it was the guy who covers Jackson County, Illinois. I told him about the A41 lake and that he could find what he was looking for right there. He asked me to make a report on the site but I did not. Now after seeing this episode of Monsters and mysteries in America and the guy from the Murphysboro salvage yard describing the scream exactly I knew I had to come forward.

I had been there for probably a couple hours and hadn't really been catching much. I had talked to a few people who were coming in on boats and seen a few going out. It seemed like a normal night for the most part. About an hour after I had seen the last person left, I was starting to get the feeling I was being watched. I shrugged it off because I know there are raccoons, possums, coyotes, even stray dogs and cats. So I dismiss it and resume my fishing. After awhile I notice how quiet it is. All I can hear is the faint breeze and the water lapping on the boat ramp where im sitting. Right about now I'm starting to get spooked. I know when there's a predator of some kind around that this usually happens. I'm an avid duck hunter, and a die hard cat fisherman, so I'm used to traipsing around in the dark. I figure its just a coyote eyeballing me so I get my flashlight and get up to take a look around. I look around for a bit and don't see anything. I once again put this out of my head, starting to think I'm losing my mind. After a little while longer I still notice there isn't any sound. As I'm sitting there staring across the lake, the hair on my arms and neck starts to stand up. I don't really spook that easy but when the hair stands up, something is watching you. I decided that I had all I could stand and threw all my stuff in my truck and left. On my way home I called dad and told him what was going on. He told me back in the  70's, there was sightings of what the town called the Salt Creek monster. I'm no skeptic, but at the same time I haven't ever seen it. After a while he tells me I should go back and check the place out a little more closely. I decided it was probably a good idea just for some peace of mind. I drive back out to the boat launch, and park in the parking lot. I have the truck lights on as well as my flashlight that I'm scanning the area with. After about 15 minutes I give up and go to leave. As I'm turning around in the parking lot, the truck lights pick something up standing in the trees. I immediately stomp on the brakes. About 20 yards away I'm looking at something that's probably seven feet tall, not overly muscular but it was covered in  black hair. It also had a big pair of yellow eyes.    It had a deer in the head lights look about it and it tore off running through the trees along the lake. I had been in track in high school and this easily outpaced the fastest runners I'd ever seen. When it ran it didn't pump its arms. They just swayed a bit. Before I really understood what I was seeing it was gone. I drove my little truck as fast as it could go all the way home. I called my dad back and remember being on the edge of hysteria. After that I always had my gun in the truck, which was always within sprinting distance of where I was fishing.", "location_details": "You would take Illinois Rt 54 out of Farmer City going west, then take a left onto Liberty Road, or as the maps say 2225 E.", "county": "De Witt County", "state": "Illinois", "season": "Summer", "title": "Report 28110: Night fisherman has sighting at Clinton Lake boat docks", "latitude": 40.19732, "longitude": -88.72399999999999, "date": "2009-06-27", "number": 28110.0, "classification": "Class A", "geohash": "dp0utj9nkg", "temperature_high": 89.98, "temperature_mid": 80.01, "temperature_low": 70.04, "dew_point": 63.47, "humidity": 0.64, "cloud_cover": 0.09, "moon_phase": 0.18, "precip_intensity": 0.0003, "precip_probability": 0.59, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1010.89, "summary": "Light rain overnight.", "uv_index": 11.0, "visibility": 10.0, "wind_bearing": 174.0, "wind_speed": 2.43, "location": "POINT(-88.72399999999999 40.19732)"}, {"observed": "July 10, 2010.

It was after sunset but not yet dark.  The temperature was in the mid 30's but the ground wasn't frozen and there were still patches of snow on the ground in places.  I came out of the woods, put my shotgun, heavy winter coat, and daypack in the trunk of my car and got inside my car to start it up when a movement to my left caught my eye. I will tell you what I saw and what I thought as I was seeing this happen.  This man/bigfoot came out of thick brush between the trees to my left on the opposite side of the road from where I was parked, maybe thirty five or forty yards down the road at an angle but it had to know that I was there or at least that my car was there. When I first saw this thing coming out of the thick brush the first thing I thought was, where in the heck did he come from....  Then, I thought, stupid guy, no hunter orange and then I began to notice strange things like he had no gun, and that he was the same color from head to toe, no hat, no hunter orange?  But then what I really noticed was that his arms were long, his hands were swinging at his knees and though he was taking large steps crossing the road very quickly but without running, he was just walking.  His arms were swinging wide like a British soldier marching but he didn't seem to be in any hurry and he completely ignored me like I wasn't there but he had to know that I was there.  He did not look over and kept his head looking straight ahead. He went into the woods on my side of the road (side I was parked on) and went down the hill and disappeared.  My eyes told me that I just saw a bigfoot but my brain and common sense was trying to dispute that.  His color was dark brown and I thought could that have been a man in a one piece Carhartt outfit or if he were a hiker lost wouldn't he just have stayed on the road rather than go down a steep hill when it was almost dark or if lost why didn't he ask me for help?  He was about six feet tall but very husky with his hands, body, feet, side of his head-face, all one color.  I actually couldn't see fur because the light was dim.  I could see the trees and tree trunks fine but not the bark because the tree trunks were silhoutetted and that's what I mean about not seeing the fur, it was all one shade of dark brown.  Now, all of this that I just told you took place in a minute or less.  Soon as it disappeared over the side of the hill I jumped out of my car, opened the trunk and loaded my shotgun (for self-defense only), put on my winter coat, and got my flashlight out of my day pack and walked to where I thought the thing went over the hill.  I wanted to check out what I just saw and was hoping to find a footprint in the ground or on a patch of snow and I went slowly back and forth, traversing this rather steep hill going a little deeper down as I moved back and forth.  There was a deep like gorge on the right side of the hill and I looked up towards the road and by now the ridge on top was just a slither of gray and looking over my shoulder I realized this was not too smart, it was pitch black below me and I got a little scared and hiked back up to the road and to my car as fast as I could.  I placed my shotgun back in the case along with my heavy coat putting them in the truck and then I drove up and down the main forest road to see if there were any cars parked off on the sides or if there were anyone walking, I saw nothing.  I drove to the valley road where I thought this thing would eventually come out at the bottom of the hill into farm fields and I drove back to the end of this valley and back hoping to see something but saw nothing.  I have been wanting to make a report of what I saw and have told my wife, children, teenage granddaughters, brother, and two close hunting buddies, but have always been hesitant to make a report.  The truth is, though I am sure what I saw wasn't a man I can't prove it wasn't a man dressed up in a suit but who would be that stupid especially during hunting season. I can't say positively that it was a bigfoot but that is what my eyes saw.  Logic says \"no\", my eyes say, \"yes\" and that's my report the best that I can remember it.

and how could if have traveled so quick to hear agian so far away? our gueses we made where - bared owl?, mule deer? dog? some sort of bear..? but we all quickly ruled out of the those. the closest was the dog. but the roar/ moan was so loud and the last 3 sec dropped to a low low growl/ mumble and no dog could make that loud of a howl of any sort. it wasnt till about half way through the 2 hour drive home to indianapolis. that my friends dad said it could have been some college kids joking around  since it was around halloweenwith a mega phone. but then we said why would college kids be up at 630 go deep into monroe forest find 3 hunters in complete camoflauge and make that noise. just none of our guesses were making sinse with that noise we heard. its not till we got back to my friends house and got on the computer and immedialely started looking up moans and roars. none matched we tried every animal noise in indiana and then we were on youtube and a video popped up . the title said bigfoot noises and pictures . thats when me and my friend look at each other and said oh my god . quickly clicking on the video a picture of so called \"big foot' showed up and then a audio started. the noise on the video was EXACTILY the same noise we hear that morning hunting. then we go to another bigfoot recording . it was very similiar to what we heard, and another and another and all the videos we listnend to matched up just right with what we heard or very close to what we heard. now before this incedent we would always make fun of the bigfoot tv shows and the people who believe in big foot. but i do not  make fun of that any more. me and my friend still talk about it today about what we heard on october 22 2009. me and my friend are both believers of big foot. or not big foot but some unknown creature that is out there and no one can seem to pin point what it is so they use the name \"bigfoot\" we never did go back to the peninsula on monroe lake that hunting year. but we did go back in october again this year to the same exact spot. we didnt hear anything but that time we didnt go back to the spot across the right bay to where we heard it and found no sign of anything out of the ordianry. it still remains a mystery of could have made that noise but as of now me and my friend both say what we heard was bigfoot. all i have said is completely true. i hope this was worth reading if you have any questions or comments on this my email is [removed] ( i would actually like if you did respond to this so i can hear what you guys have to say about my story) thanks", "location_details": "back on windie roads if not fimiliar with the area it will be very dificult to find.", "county": "Monroe County", "state": "Indiana", "season": "Fall", "title": "Report 28861: Loud, early morning vocalizations heard by duck hunters near Lake Monroe", "latitude": 39.02502, "longitude": -86.49139, "date": "2009-10-22", "number": 28861.0, "classification": "Class B", "geohash": "dnfqpb6chw", "temperature_high": 67.45, "temperature_mid": 63.17, "temperature_low": 58.89, "dew_point": 51.86, "humidity": 0.79, "cloud_cover": 0.3, "moon_phase": 0.15, "precip_intensity": 0.001, "precip_probability": 0.83, "precip_type": "rain", "pressure": 1014.28, "summary": "Rain overnight.", "uv_index": 4.0, "visibility": 9.65, "wind_bearing": 140.0, "wind_speed": 1.02, "location": "POINT(-86.49139 39.02502)"}, {"observed": "I have reported before on this website.

When I got back out of the car and went to close the door, I noticed something moving in the field next to my aunt's property.  A very large and definitely bipedal animal was walking down the field towards the woods.  It walked with a long and sort of slouched gait.  It was either covered with really dark brown or black fur and had rather long arms that swung loosely as it moved.  It crossed the distance of at least 200 feet in less than 20 seconds.

She was travelling east on County road 1100 North.  She approached the intersection with County road 300 East, which leads into Oswego, and came to a stop at the stop sign.  She looked left, right and briefly ahead.  Before beginning her turn she noticed movement directly ahead on road 1100 N.  She saw crossing the road from left to right,(heading south) approximately 250 feet ahead, two large, black, hair covered figures, taller than an average man walking on two legs at a hurried pace. Her first reaction was to say out loud \"what the heck was that?\".  The way they were walking very close together and hurrying suggested that they were aware they were exposed in the open and wanted to get back to cover quickly.  By the time she saw them they were in the middle of the road but she saw them take 5 to 7 steps over several seconds.  They were stooped forward and looking down and swinging their long arms quickly.  After this they entered the woods.  She said they were close enough to have scared her if they had looked her way.  Also, they were close enough to see they were not just men in black clothing as there were no divisions where shirt, pants and a hat would be; only solid black from head to toe. My wife, who is a college educated professional, then made her turn onto 300E thinking she would then have something interesting to tell me immediately upon arriving home.  When she reached home however, something else unusual happened. Instead of telling me, she apparently blocked out or repressed the experience from her memory, as if in denial.  I have been a Bigfoot enthusiast for many years and have read of this happening before to people seeing a Bigfoot.  It is like your mind refuses to believe what the eyes are telling it because it is so new, different and without a reference point. About 2 days later we were talking and I said something that brought it all back to her suddenly.  She then told me the whole experience in detail, showing signs of alarm and even imitating the way they walked. Of course I wasn`t about to believe her without asking questions.  After all I was the Biology major in college, I'm the outdoorsman and I'm the bigfoot enthusiast - I'm the one who should have seen them! I asked all the typical questions that the BFRO interviewers asked and she answered them all correctly, even adding additional detail. I asked if they might possibly be some young high school guys in all black Gothic clothes, as some of them like to wear. The answer was \"they were absolutely not men in black clothes\".  The thought also occurred to me that she was messing with me - playing a joke to mislead me, so I asked. This was the last straw; she got hurt and angry with me for not trusting her after 27 years of marriage, and I got the silent treatment for 2 days and had to do a lot of apologizing.  I'll have to just agree with her - based on the evidence, she saw 2 Bigfoots crossing the road.  Wish I had seen them! Hopefully, by learning as much as I can about this creature I will be able to remain calm enough to stay and observe it, if I ever see one, instead of freak out and run as most do.  Some may say \"your wife learned all this from listening to you go on and on about what you read on the internet.  Believe me, when she tells her story you can tell it was a very real experience for her; whether anyone believes her or not she knows what she saw, and will say so.", "location_details": "300 feet east of the intersection of county roads 1100 north and 300 east.
